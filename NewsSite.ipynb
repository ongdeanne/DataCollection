       "  'Title': \"Scientists unlock the 'Cosmos' on the Antikythera Mechanism, the world's first computer\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Scientists may have finally made a complete digital model for the Cosmos panel of a 2,000-year-old mechanical device called the Antikythera mechanism that\\'s believed to be the world\\'s first computer. First discovered in a Roman-era shipwreck by Greek sponge divers in 1900, the fragments of a shoebox-size contraption, once filled with gears and used to predict the movements of heavenly bodies, has both baffled and amazed generations of researchers ever since. The discovered fragments made up just one-third of a larger device: a highly-sophisticated hand-powered gearbox capable of accurately predicting the motions of the five planets known to the ancient Greeks, as well as the sun, the phases of the moon and the solar and lunar eclipses — displaying them all relative to the timings of ancient events such as the Olympic Games. Related: Photos: Ancient Greek shipwreck yields Antikythera mechanism Yet despite years of painstaking research and debate, scientists were never able to fully replicate the mechanism that drove the astonishing device, or the calculations used in its design, from the battered and corroded brass fragments discovered in the wreck. But now researchers at University College London say they have fully recreated the design of the device, from the ancient calculations used to create it, and are now putting together their own contraption to see if their design works. \"Our work reveals the Antikythera Mechanism as a beautiful conception, translated by superb engineering into a device of genius,\" the researchers wrote on March 12 in the open-access journal Scientific Reports. \"It challenges all our preconceptions about the technological capabilities of the ancient Greeks.\"  The researchers wanted to recreate the device because of all the mystery surrounding it, as a way to possibly get to the bottom of so many questions. In addition, nobody had ever created a model of the so-called Cosmos that reconciled with all of the physical evidence. \"The distance between this device\\'s complexity and others made at the same time is infinite,\" co-author Adam Wojcik, a materials scientist at UCL, told Live Science. \"Frankly, there is nothing like it that has ever been found. It\\'s out of this world.\" The intricate gears that made up the device\\'s mechanism are of a scale you could expect to find in a grandfather clock, but the only other gears discovered from around the same period are the much larger ones that went into things like ballistas, or large crossbows, and catapults. This sophistication brings up a lot of questions about the manufacturing process that could have made such a uniquely intricate contraption, as well as why it was discovered as the only known device of its kind on an ancient sunken ship off the island of Antikythera. Related: The 20 most mysterious shipwrecks ever \"What is it doing on that ship? We only found one-third; where are the other two [thirds]? Have they corroded away? Did it ever work?\" Wojcik said. \"These are questions that we can only really answer through experimental archaeology. It\\'s like answering how they built Stonehenge, let\\'s get 200 people with some rope and a big stone and try to pull it across Salisbury Plain. That\\'s a bit like what we\\'re trying to do here.\"  To create the model, the researchers drew on all of the past research on the device, including that of Michael Wright, a former curator at the Science Museum in London, who had previously constructed a working replica. Using inscriptions found on the mechanism and a mathematical model of how the planets moved that was first devised by the ancient Greek philosopher Parmenides, they were able to create a computer model for a mechanism of overlapping gears that fit inside a just barely 1-inch-deep (2.5 centimeters) compartment. Related: Ancient Greek Antikythera Mechanism came with a user guide Their model recreates each gear and rotating dial to show how the planets, the sun and the moon move across the Zodiac (the ancient map of the stars) on the front face and the phases of the moon and eclipses on the back. It replicates the now-outdated ancient Greek assumption that all of the heavens revolved around the Earth. Now that the computer model has been made, the researchers want to make physical versions, first using modern techniques so they can check that the device works, and then employing the techniques that could have been used by the ancient Greeks. —30 of the world\\'s most valuable treasures that are still missing —The 25 most mysterious archaeological finds on Earth —10 biggest historical mysteries that will probably never be solved \"There\\'s no evidence that the ancient Greeks were able to build something like this. It really is a mystery,\" said Wojcik. \"The only way to test if they could is to try to build it the ancient Greek way.\" \"And there\\'s also a lot of debate about who it was for and who built it. A lot of people say it was Archimedes,\" Wojcik said. \"He lived around the same time it was constructed, and no one else had the same level of engineering ability that he did. It was also a Roman shipwreck.\" Archimedes was killed by Romans during the Siege of Syracuse, after the weapons he invented failed to prevent them from capturing the city. Mysteries also remain as to whether the ancient Greeks used similar techniques to make other, yet-to-be-discovered, devices or whether copies of the Antikythera mechanism are waiting to be found. \"It\\'s a bit like having a TARDIS appear in the Stone Age,\" said Wojcik, referring to Doctor Who\\'s time-traveling spacecraft.

       "  'Title': 'Why do dogs and cats run around in random bursts of speed?',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'One moment a pup is peacefully eating kibble, and the next it\\'s running around the house like there\\'s a fire burning under its tail. These episodes of \"zoomies\" last for up to several minutes, but they can feel much longer when a dog bulldozes through a crowded home. So, why do dogs, cats and other pets dash around for no apparent reason? \"They\\'re just having fun,\" said José Arce, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association. These bursts of energy, technically called frenetic random activity periods (FRAPs), are natural and seen in many domesticated and wild animal species. Related: Why do dogs have cold noses? FRAPs may appear random, but a few triggers are common for dogs. When an owner lets a dog out of its crate, the pup may zoom around to let out energy it built up throughout the day. Similarly, an owner coming home after work can trigger a dog to run around in a brief stint of exercise after an hours-long nap. Another frequent time for FRAPs is after a bath, possibly to release nervous energy or excitement from getting bathed, Arce told Live Science. Dogs\\' full-body shakes are highly effective, so the post-bath time zoomies likely aren\\'t for drying off. Cats have different triggers. Whereas pups get zoomies throughout the day, felines are more likely to get them at dusk and dawn because that\\'s when they\\'re most active. They also tend to experience FRAPs after grooming and using the litter box. Arce usually feeds his own cats dry food, but when he breaks out the occasional can of wet food, they race around his home. \"They get really happy and excited, and they run up and down the hall and jump on the couch,\" he said. When cats get the zoomies, they tend to sprint for less time than dogs. More athletic and high-strung dog breeds, like Australian shepherds, may do them more often than laid-back dogs, probably because they need to let their energy out more frequently, Arce said. Wild animals as far-ranging as ferrets and elephants also perform FRAPs. The behavior is sometimes called \"binkies\" in rabbits and is thought to be an expression of excitement, according to a 2020 study in the Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science. Bunny binkies can appear as running, twisting the head or body around, and hopping or jumping in the air. —Why do dogs scratch the ground after they pee? —Are dogs really smiling at us? —Why do dogs bury bones? Although FRAPs are a normal behavior, some pet owners misinterpret the frantic energy and worry that their dog is stressed or ill, Arce said. They may misread zoomies as obsessive compulsive behaviors. Dogs with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) may chase their tails, follow shadows, snap at the air like they\\'re trying to catch a fly and mop the floor with their tongues — but zooming around the house is not a sign of OCD in dogs. If you\\'re unsure whether your pet is engaging in zoomies or having OCD symptoms, Arce recommended recording a video of the behavior and showing it to your veterinarian. Zoomies themselves aren\\'t particularly dangerous. Arce has never heard of a pet getting a serious injury from zoomies. If you\\'re indoors and worried, remove any fragile objects from the dog\\'s path. If it happens on a walk, keep firm control of the leash so your dog doesn\\'t dash away. If you bring your dog somewhere that could be dangerous for a FRAP, such as sightseeing at a cliff, consider letting the pet get out any excess energy beforehand.

       "  'Title': \"US Air Force says it will test bizarre 'hypersonic' weapon this month\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'At some point in the next few weeks, a B-52H bomber will carry a missile high into the air and launch it at an unprecedented velocity toward its target, according to the U.S. Air Force. If everything goes according to plan, that missile will accelerate to more than five times the speed of sound before deploying a dummy second stage that will promptly \"disintegrate\" somewhere in the atmosphere. The missile, known as AGM-183A, is supposed to be the first hypersonic weapon — or Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) — in the U.S. arsenal. It should move so quickly through the atmosphere — about 20 times the speed of sound — at such low altitudes that it\\'s impossible for enemy missile defense systems to shoot out of the air. And its speed means that it can be useful for destroying \"high-value, time-sensitive targets,\" the Air Force said in a statement. Hypersonic missile designs, including this one, typically involve two stages. First, a rocket accelerates the weapon to many times the speed of sound, while remaining at a much lower altitude than Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) that arc high above the atmosphere before delivering their nuclear payloads.  Second, it releases a glider that carries the weapon for the final leg of its journey to the target, riding the atmosphere like a surfer bobbing and weaving over waves — adding another wrinkle to any attempt to shoot it down. That lower altitude, in theory, makes a hypersonic weapon harder to detect and more difficult to destroy: \\xa0It\\'s harder to detect for the same reason that it\\'s harder to see an airplane when you’re standing on the ground at an airport 5 miles away than an airplane 10 miles away in the air approaching that airport to land; the closer an object is to the ground, the more stuff — from trees to buildings to another airplane — gets in the way. And a hypersonic missile is theoretically harder to shoot down for more or less the same reason; most missile defense technology is designed to intercept an ICBM close to the peak of its arc through space. Up there, a missile defense system has a clearer line of sight to the target and the ICBM itself moves in a more predictable way. A Mach 20 hypersonic glider would actually move at about the same speed as a decades-old ICBM, which can accelerate to similar velocities during its space travel but must cover a much longer distance to reach the same target. (It\\'s the difference between driving in a straight line from New York to San Francisco and driving between the two cities with a stopover in the Arctic Circle.) Related: 7 technologies that transformed warfare The U.S. isn\\'t the only country working on hypersonic weapons technology. As Live Science previously reported, Russian President Vladimir Putin first announced his country\\'s own hypersonic weapons program in 2018, promising the nation\\'s hypersonic weapon would reach Mach 20. Pavel Podvig, a military analyst, told Live Science at the time that such weapons likely won\\'t be useful.. \"It has been described as a weapon in search of a mission,\" he said. \"My take is, you don\\'t really need this kind of capability. It doesn\\'t really change much in terms of ability to hit targets.\" —Could the US stop nuclear weapons? —Voyager to Mars rover: NASA\\'s 10 greatest innovations —Photos: Hypersonic jet could fly 10 times the speed of sound That\\'s because ICBMs are already perfectly capable of evading missile defense systems. The U.S. has the most advanced missile defense technology in the world; and according to Union of Concerned Scientists physicist Laura Grego and many other analysts it simply does not work. So it\\'s not clear why a hypersonic missile would be necessary for striking any other country. The Air Force does emphasize the idea that an ARRW might be useful against \"time sensitive\" targets, because of its high speed (at least compared to non-ICBM missiles typically used to deliver non-nuclear weapons). The danger of hypersonic weapons, Podvig said, is that they aren\\'t covered by existing treaties designed to prevent arms races. And there\\'s still a great deal of uncertainty around the technology. \"These systems create greater risks of [strategic] miscalculation,\" Podvig said, \"and it\\'s not clear if we can effectively deal with those risks.\" Meanwhile, there are questions about whether hypersonic tech will work at all. The upcoming test will only demonstrate the missile itself, not the glider, which is the more cutting-edge technology. (Rockets that go very fast have existed for a long time. Gliders that fly many times faster than an F-16 have not.) And, as The Drive pointed out, this test has also been delayed. The missile arrived at Edwards Air Force Base in California on March 1, and the service had originally said the test would take place by March 6. Then, the March 5 statement extended that timeline to \"the next 30 days\" without explanation. Meanwhile, an independent analysis published in 2020 in the journal Science and Global Security argued that \"fundamental physics\" puts hard limits on the usefulness of these weapons. They showed that the physics of atmospheric flight prevent these weapons from ever going fast enough to substantially outpace ICBMs, and that it would be relatively easy to detect a hypersonic missile launch with the right satellite. The idea that hypersonic missiles would offer a revolutionary upgrade over ICBMs, the researchers argued, is a \"social\" phenomenon, not a scientific one. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Beached sperm whale in Australia shows scars from tussle with a giant squid',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'A huge dead whale rotting away on an island Down Under is attracting locals and even thieves, but the rancid smell of its decomposing corpse is keeping many of them at bay. One man who went to see the whale said its decaying blubber ruined his sneakers, and others have noted that they could smell the fetid stench even at a distance of 3 miles (5 kilometers), according to news sources. Pathogens on the whale\\'s mouldering body are another reason to steer clear of the area, said the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) in Gippsland in Australia. In short, people should stay away from the beach, especially because hungry sharks could be swimming nearby, hoping to take a bite of the 52-foot-long (16 meters) sperm whale, the department said. Whale carcasses often pose a problem when they wash ashore, as gases that build up inside their decaying bodies can lead to nasty explosions. Sometimes, local authorities will preemptively blow up dead whales, as they did in 1970 to a sperm whale in the now aptly named \"Exploding Whale Memorial Park,\" in Oregon, a decision they quickly came to regret. \"The humor of the situation suddenly gave way to a run for survival, as huge chunks of whale blubber fell everywhere,\" Paul Linnman, a reporter who covered the explosion, said at the time. \"Pieces of meat passed high over our heads, while others were falling at our feet.\" Related: Whale photos: Giants of the deep In this case, a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) — the world\\'s largest toothed whale — washed ashore at Forrest Caves beach, a popular scenic destination on Phillip Island in southern Australia on March 6, DELWP Gippsland reported in a Facebook post. The female whale\\'s final resting place on the beach is difficult to reach with a machine or vehicle large enough to move the animal, so \"the whale will be left in place and not removed,\" DELWP Gippsland wrote.  The department added that it\\'s illegal for people and their dogs to get within 980 feet (300 m) of a whale, even a dead one. It\\'s also illegal to take or possess dead whale parts, they said. But that hasn\\'t stopped determined thieves from using the cover of night to steal parts of the whale\\'s jaw, The Guardian reported. Even in death, the whale is helping scientists learn about sperm whale behavior and biology. Researchers have taken tissue samples, DELWP reported. Meanwhile, \"sucker marks\" on the whale\\'s side indicate that the beast tussled with a giant squid, Mike Cleeland, an education officer at Bunurong Environment Centre in Inverloch, Australia, told Gippsland ABC Radio.  Just like another beached sperm whale he saw in the 1980s in Australia, this whale \"had these sucker marks of up to about 10 centimeters [4 inches] diameter,\" Cleeland said, as reported by the Sentinel-Times. \"These sperm whales dive down to a kilometer [0.6 miles] or more in depth to feed on the giant squids, but if they come up to a squid and the squid tries to defend itself by wrapping itself around the sperm whale, they finish up with these sucker marks — and that was apparent on this one at Forrest Caves.\" —Images: Sharks & whales from above —15 of the largest animals of their kind on Earth —In photos: Tracking humpback whales However, it\\'s unknown what actually killed the whale. \"There\\'s no obvious cause of death, so it may have simply reached the end of its natural life and washed in on its nearest beach here on Phillip Island,\" Cleeland said. Another dead whale, a 16-foot-long (5 m) humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) was found offshore in Port Phillip Bay not too far from Phillip Island, and \"plans are in progress to relocate the whale tomorrow,\" DELWP Victoria wrote on Twitter on March 11.

       "  'Full Article': 'An 11-year-old boy went for a desert hike with his parents and discovered a child-protecting figurine dating to the biblical era, about 2,500 years ago. Zvi Ben-David and his family were hiking near Nahal HaBesor, a river that runs through the Negev Desert in southern Israel, when he spotted an object that turned out to be a ceramic statuette of a woman, representatives with the Israel Antiquities Authorities (IAA) wrote on Facebook on March 9. The small figure had a prominent nose, a scarf covering her head and crossed arms folded under her bare breasts. The statuette, which measured about 3 inches (7 centimeters) tall and (6 cm) wide, was likely cast from a mold, according to the Facebook post. During the fifth and sixth centuries B.C., such figurines were commonly used as good luck amulets, for protecting children or promoting fertility, the IAA says. Related: The Holy Land: 7 amazing archaeological finds After Ben-David found the artifact, his mother Miriam Ben-David, a professional tour guide, contacted IAA archaeologist Oren Shmueli and arranged to deliver the figurine to the IAA\\'s National Treasures\\xa0Department, for research and preservation. Shmueli and Debora Ben-Ami, curator of the Iron Age and Persian periods for the IAA, will further investigate the figurine\\xa0to better understand how representations of human figures were incorporated into superstitious rituals during biblical times, Shmueli said. Throughout Israel\\'s past, figurines of bare-breasted women were commonly found in people\\'s homes, \"like the\\xa0hamsa\\xa0symbol today\" — a Middle Eastern amulet shaped like a hand with an open eye in the palm, displayed or worn to ward off bad luck and protect against the evil eye, according to the Facebook post.

       "  'Title': 'Traces of ancient magma ocean found in Greenland',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Rocks collected in Greenland may hold traces of an ancient magma ocean that bubbled over much of Earth\\'s surface soon after the planet\\'s birth, a new study finds. Scientists gathered the rocks from the Isua supracrustal belt, a region in southwest Greenland where the exposed rocks are between 3.7 billion and 3.8 billion years old; the belt contains the oldest known rocks on Earth, which remain relatively undisturbed by plate tectonics, heat and chemical alterations, according to Science Magazine. The chemical traces of the early magma oceans are even older than the rocks themselves, dating to roughly 4.5 billion years ago, when a Mars-size object slammed into Earth, knocking off a huge chunk of rock that later became the moon, according to the new study. When celestial objects the size of Earth and Mars collide, \"near-wholescale melting of the entire planet is an inevitable consequence of that,\" lead author Helen Williams, a professor of geochemistry at the University of Cambridge, told Live Science. And as that molten rock cooled and crystallized, the Earth gradually came to resemble the blue marble we know today, she said. Related: Earth has a hidden layer, and no one knows exactly what it is But although most scientists accept the molten Earth theory, \"a big challenge is that it\\'s very hard to find ... geological evidence for something that happened so early on in our history,\" Williams said. The new study, published March 12 in the journal Science Advances, shows that Isua belt rocks still bear chemical \"fingerprints\" left behind by this primordial cooling process. Williams began hunting for these fingerprints after she and her co-author Hanika Rizo, an associate professor at the Carleton University in Canada, met at an American Geophysical Union (AGU) fall meeting, an annual event that in pre-pandemic times, drew tens of thousands of scientists from all over the world. Rizo had previously extracted rock samples from the Isua supracrustal belt and wrote about them in a 2011 study, published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters. In the paper, she noted that the rocks carried certain chemical signatures, namely unique isotopes, or chemical elements with varying numbers of neutrons. Williams later read the report, and these chemical signatures piqued her interest. \"Her paper doesn\\'t have direct geological evidence for the magma ocean in it. But so many of the chemical tracers that she discusses ... really point in that general direction,\" Williams said. If they studied the samples further, Williams thought, they may uncover a snapshot of Earth\\'s molten past. So when she spotted Rizo from across the expansive AGU conference hall, \"I basically took off running towards her, because I really wanted to talk ... about the possibility of collaborating,\" Williams said. To kick off their collaboration, the scientists headed to the lab. They selected a subset of volcanic rocks from the Isua samples, choosing only the most pristine, in terms of how much wear-and-tear they\\'d undergone after erupting to the surface and becoming exposed to the elements. They then sawed off the exposed surfaces of the rocks, sanded them down, crushed them into a fine powder and dissolved the powder in strong acids. —15 incredible places on Earth that are frozen in time —Photos: Artistic views of Earth from above —Too hot to handle: 7 sizzling places on Planet Earth \"By the time you\\'re done, it\\'s sort of incredible, that something that was a really hard, dense rock in your hand, is now actually a little vial of liquid in your laboratory,\" Williams said. Processing the rocks in this way allowed the team to examine isotopes, or chemical elements with varying numbers of neutrons, within the samples. Specifically, the team was looking for isotopes that would have formed as the magma oceans crystalized. Models suggest that some remnants of these crystals would have been trapped in the lower mantle, close to the Earth\\'s core, and preserved for billions of years. Through time, they would migrate through the lower mantle to the upper mantle, carrying the \"isotope fingerprints\" of the magma ocean with them, Williams said. These fingerprints include hafnium and neodymium isotopes, which form when their parent isotopes decay; this breakdown occurs in a specific pattern when the parent isotopes are placed under extremely high pressures, like those found in the depths of the lower mantle, Williams said. The team found these unique isotopes in the Isua samples, along with a rare form of the element tungsten; known as a \"tungsten anomaly,\" these unusual tungsten isotopes stem from an ancient parent isotope that existed only in the first 45 million years of Earth\\'s history, Williams said. As these crystal residues moved upward from the lower to upper mantle, they melted and mixed with other molten rock, creating a marbling effect. So once that mixed-up rock breached the crust, it carried the isotope fingerprints along with rock from both the upper and lower mantles; this was true of the Isua samples. There are several theories as to how and why the crystals migrated upward through Earth\\'s layers, one being that the crystals repeatedly melted and recrystallized, becoming more concentrated as they inched upward, Williams said. After uncovering the chemical traces of magma oceans, \"the question I have is whether other ancient rocks on Earth preserved the same signatures,\" Williams said. She and her team are beginning to hunt for these signatures at sites across the globe, searching in locations with extremely ancient rocks and at modern hotspots for volcanic activity, such as Hawai\\'i and Iceland. \"Many lines of evidence ... suggest that these modern hotspots are derived from melting of material really deep within the Earth, maybe even originating from close to the boundary between the Earth\\'s mantle and its core,\" Williams said. That means that chemical traces of the magma ocean may also be lurking in these hotspots, though we don\\'t know that for sure yet, she said. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': 'The most remote particle detector on Earth has detected the most energetic antimatter particle ever: a single ultralight particle that smacked into the Antarctic ice with the (relatively) thundering energy of 6,300 flying mosquitos. The collision occurred in 2016, but researchers only confirmed the details of the event March 10 in a paper published in the journal Nature. This antineutrino, an antimatter counterpart of the wispy, difficult-to-detect particles known as neutrino, collided with an electron somewhere in the ice of Antarctica at nearly the speed of light. That collision created a shower of particles detected by the buried IceCube Neutrino Observatory — a facility responsible for much of the important high-energy neutrino research of the last decade, as Live Science has reported. Now, IceCube physicists report that that particle shower included evidence of a long-theorized but never-before-seen event known as \"Glashow resonance.\" Back in 1960, the physicist Stephen Glashow, then a post-graduate researcher at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Denmark, predicted that when a sufficiently high-energy antineutrino collided with an electron it would produce a heavy, short-lived particle known as a W boson. Glashow\\'s prediction relied on the fundamental rules of the Standard Model of particle physics, a theory that dominates how researchers understand everything from the insides of atoms to light to antimatter. Related: 5 elusive particles that may be lurking in the universe Detecting Glashow\\'s resonance is a powerful confirmation of the Standard Model. But it requires the neutrino to carry far more energy than any particle accelerator from 1960 — or 2021 — can produce: 6.3 petaelectronvolts (PeV). —The 18 biggest unsolved mysteries in physics —5 reasons we may live in a multiverse —Antarctica: The ice-covered bottom of the world in photos It\\'s usually difficult to wrap one\\'s mind around the numbers involved in high-energy particles. A single neutrino has a mass of about 2 billion-billion-billion-billionths of a gram, and thousands of low-energy neutrinos from the sun pass through your body every second of the day without noticeable effects. A neutrino with 6.3 petaelectronvolts (PeV) of energy is another beast entirely. According to CERN, the European physics laboratory, a teraelectronvolt (TeV) is equivalent to the energy of a single mosquito flying at 1 mph (1.6 km/h). And 6.3 PeV is 6,300 TeV. So turn that single mosquito into a swarm of 6,300 (or accelerate it to Mach-8.2, more than four times the top speed of an F-16) and you\\'ve got the energy of the single infinitesimal particle required for Glashow\\'s resonance. Another way to think of 6.3 PeV: It\\'s 450 times the maximum energy that the Large Hadron Collider — CERN\\'s 17-mile-long (27 kilometers), multibillion dollar accelerator responsible for the detection of the Higgs boson — should be able to produce by the late 2020s following ongoing upgrades. Given the huge energy required, no one hoped to spot Glashow\\'s resonance using only human tools. But IceCube, which detects particles that fall out of the sky, gets an assist from the vast universe. The particle that smacked into the ice in 2016 produced a characteristic shower of particles that researchers now say came from a decaying W boson, which is a fundamental particle that along with the Z boson is thought to be responsible for the weak force. And that\\'s the telltale sign of a 6.3-PeV antineutrino and Glashow\\'s resonance. The researchers still aren\\'t sure what cosmic accelerator produced the monstrous speck of antimatter, but said more events should help them refine their models of whatever natural space canons produce such extreme particles and fire them at Earth.

Slender-tailed meerkats (Suricata suricatta) interacted more positively with each other after humans returned to their exhibits, while African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) just carried on as if nothing had changed. Researchers studied the behavior of the animals before and after zoos reopened in the U.K. and South Africa to learn more about how lockdown affected them. Their results were published in the March issue of the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science. \"We can\\'t say what the animals were feeling, but the positive behaviors that we observed (e.g. positive social interactions with each other and positive human-animal interactions) suggest the return of visitors was a positive and engaging experience for the meerkats,\" first author Ellen Williams, a lecturer in animal behavior and welfare at Harper Adams University in the U.K., told Live Science in an email. Related: Photos of flightless birds: All 18 penguin species More than 700 million people normally visit zoos and aquariums around the world each year, according to the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Both animal haunts, however, were forced to suddenly shut their gates in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving animals alone — except for the few staff that continued to work — in near-empty parks. Zookeepers began reporting that animals were suffering without the company of visitors. Animals like meerkats were \"missing their human friends\" in New Zealand zoos, The Guardian reported in April 2020, and staff at the Singapore Zoo were taking their African penguins for walks in May to help keep them stimulated without visitors, the Daily Mail reported. These anecdotes led Williams and her colleagues to wonder how the animals were faring during lockdown. \"Obviously, zoos are not usually closed for long periods of time and so this study offered us a unique opportunity to understand more about how the meerkats and African penguins were behaving when there were no visitors,\" Williams said. Meerkat keepers at Knowsley Safari Park, Twycross Zoo and Plantasia, all in the U.K., and penguin keepers at uShaka Sea World in South Africa monitored their animals during 5-minute windows and recorded behaviors for the researchers to study. They noted the behaviors the animals were performing, such as foraging for food, and where the animals were positioned in the enclosure, according to the study. The meerkats appeared to react well to visitors returning by interacting positively with each other more often with behaviors such as playing and grooming. They were, however, also more alert once visitors returned and spent longer in parts of their enclosure farthest from visitor viewing areas compared with during lockdown. The penguins behaved the same regardless of whether there were visitors at their zoo, suggesting they didn\\'t care much either way. The research was designed as a pilot study, and the authors advocate for more research over a longer period to better understand the effect that zoo visitors have on the animals. — Photos: Belfast Zoo\\'s new giraffe — 13 extremely strange animal feet — Photos: Stunning shots of the natural world and wildlife \"Even the meerkats were potentially feeling a little isolated,\" Eduardo Fernandez, a senior lecturer in animal behavior, welfare and ethics at The University of Adelaide in Australia, told Live Science after reading the study. \"I would say that like most good science, what this paper does is open up a whole lot more questions about where to go in the future with understanding what are both the positive and negative impacts that visitors can have on animals, and then vice versa,\" Fernandez said.

       "  'Title': \"What fueled humans' big brains? Controversial paper proposes new hypothesis.\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Over the course of the Pleistocene epoch, between 2.6 million years ago and 11,700 years ago, the brains of humans and their relatives grew. Now, scientists from Tel Aviv University have a new hypothesis as to why: As the largest animals on the landscape disappeared, the scientists propose, human brains had to grow to enable the hunting of smaller, swifter prey. This hypothesis argues that early humans specialized in taking down the largest animals, such as elephants, which would have provided ample fatty meals. When these animals\\' numbers declined, humans with bigger brains, who presumably had more brainpower, were better at adapting and capturing smaller prey, which led to better survival for the brainiacs. Ultimately, adult human brains expanded from an average of 40 cubic inches (650 cubic centimeters) at 2 million years ago to about 92 cubic inches (1,500 cubic cm) on the cusp of the agricultural revolution about 10,000 years ago. The hypothesis also explains why brain size shrank slightly, to about 80 cubic inches (1,300 cubic cm), after farming began: The extra tissue was no longer needed to maximize hunting success. Related: See photos of our closest human ancestor This new hypothesis bucks a trend in human origins studies. Many scholars in the field now argue that human brains grew in response to a lot of little pressures, rather than one big one. But Tel Aviv University archaeologists Miki Ben-Dor and Ran Barkai argue that one major change in the environment would provide a better explanation. \"We see the decline in prey size as a unifying explanation not only to brain expansion, but to many other transformations in human biology and culture, and we claim it provides a good incentive for these changes,\" Barkai wrote in an email to Live Science. \"[Scholars of human origins] are not used to looking for a single explanation that will cover a diversity of adaptations. It is time, we believe, to think otherwise.\" The growth of the human brain is evolutionarily outstanding, because the brain is a costly organ. The Homo sapiens brain uses 20% of the body\\'s oxygen at rest despite making up only 2% of the body\\'s weight. An average human brain today weighs 2.98 lbs. (1,352 grams), far exceeding the brains of chimpanzees, our nearest living relatives, at 0.85 lb. (384 grams). Related: In photos: Hominin skulls with mixed traits discovered Barkai and Ben-Dor\\'s hypothesis hinges on the notion that human ancestors, starting with Homo habilis and peaking with Homo erectus, spent the early Pleistocene as expert carnivores, taking down the biggest, slowest prey that Africa had to offer. Megaherbivores, the researchers argue in a paper published March 5 in the journal Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, would have provided ample calories and nutrients with less effort than foraging plants or stalking smaller prey. Modern humans are better at digesting fat than other primates are, Barkai and Ben-Dor said, and humans\\' physiology, including stomach acidity and gut design, indicate adaptations for eating fatty meat. In another paper, published Feb. 19 in the journal Quaternary, the researchers argue that human species\\' tools and lifestyle are consistent with a shift from large prey to small prey. In Barkai\\'s fieldwork in Africa, for example, he has found Homo erectus sites strewn with elephant bones, which disappear at later sites from between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago. The human ancestors at those more recent sites seemed to have been eating mostly fallow deer, Ben-Dor wrote in an email to Live Science. Overall, megaherbivores weighing over 2,200 lbs. (1,000 kilograms) began to decline across Africa around 4.6 million years ago, with herbivores over 770 lbs. (350 kg) declining around 1 million years ago, the researchers wrote in their paper. It\\'s not clear what caused this decline, but it could have been climate change, human hunting or a combination of the two. As the biggest, slowest, fattiest animals disappeared from the landscape, humans would have been forced to adapt by switching to smaller animals. This switch, the researchers argue, would have put evolutionary pressure on human brains to grow larger because hunting small animals would have been more complicated, given that smaller prey is harder to track and catch. These growing brains would then explain many of the behavioral changes across the Pleistocene. Hunters of small, fleet prey may have needed to develop language and complex social structures to successfully communicate the location of prey and coordinate tracking it. Better control of fire would have allowed human ancestors to extract as many calories as possible from smaller animals, including grease and oil from their bones. Tool and weapon technology would have had to advance to allow hunters to bring down and dress small game, according to Barkai and Ben-Dor. Single hypotheses for human brain evolution haven\\'t held up well in the past, however, said Richard Potts, a paleoanthropologist and head of the Smithsonian\\'s Human Origins Program in Washington, D.C., location, who wasn\\'t involved in the research. And there are debates about many of the arguments in the new hypothesis. For example, Potts told Live Science, it\\'s not clear whether early humans hunted megaherbivores at all. There are human cut marks on large-mammal bones at some sites, but no one knows whether the humans killed the animals or scavenged them. The researchers also sometimes use arguments from one time period that might not apply to earlier times and places, Potts said. For example, the evidence suggests a preference for large prey by Neanderthals living in Europe 400,000 years ago, which would have served those human relatives well in winter, when plants were scarce. But the same thing might not have held true a few hundred thousand or a million years earlier in tropical Africa, Potts said. And when it comes to brains, size isn\\'t everything. Complicating the picture, brain shape also evolved over the Pleistocene, and some human relatives — such as Homo floresiensis, which lived in what is now Indonesia between 60,000 and 100,000 years ago — had small brains. H. floresiensis hunted both small elephants and large rodents despite its small brain. The period over which humans and their relatives experienced this brain expansion is poorly understood, with few fossil records to go on. For example, there are perhaps three or four sites firmly dated to between 300,000 and 400,000 years ago in Africa that are certainly related to humans and their ancestors, said John Hawks, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was not involved in the research and was skeptical of its conclusions. The human family tree was complicated over the course of the Pleistocene, with many branches, and the growth in brain size wasn\\'t linear. Nor were the declines in large animals, Hawks told Live Science. — 10 things we learned about our human ancestors in 2020 — Top 10 mysteries of the first humans —Photos: Bones from a Denisovan-Neanderthal hybrid \"They\\'ve sketched out a picture in which the megaherbivores decline and the brains increase, and if you look at that through a telescope, it sort of looks true,\" Hawks told Live Science. \"But actually, if you look at the details on either side, brain size was more complicated, megaherbivores were more complicated and it\\'s not like we can draw a straightforward relationship between them.\" The paper does, however, draw attention to the fact that human species may indeed have hunted large mammals during the Pleistocene, Hawks said. There is a natural bias in fossil sites against preserving large mammals, because human hunters or scavengers wouldn\\'t have dragged an entire elephant back to camp; they would have sliced off packets of meat instead, leaving no evidence of the feast at their home sites for future paleontologists and archaeologists. \"I\\'m sure we\\'re going to be talking more and more about what was the role of megaherbivores in human subsistence, and were they important to us becoming human?\" Hawks said.

       "  'Title': 'More twins are being born than ever before',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Twin births are multiplying, a new study finds. Worldwide, more twins are being born now than ever before. Since the 1980s, the rate of twin births worldwide has increased by more than 30%, from 9 twin births per 1,000 deliveries in 1980-1985, to 12 twin births per 1,000 deliveries in 2010-2015. What\\'s more, the absolute number of twin deliveries increased by 42% during this period — from 1.1 million twin deliveries in the early 1980s to 1.6 million deliveries in the early 2010s. For comparison, the total number of births worldwide increased by only 8% during the same period. Medically-assisted reproduction, which includes in vitro fertilization (IVF), or when an egg is fertilized with sperm in a lab dish and transferred to the uterus, may largely explain this rise, the authors said. IVF increases the chance of twins if more than one embryo is transferred. However, some regions of the world may have reached \"peak twinning\" as fertility specialists \\xa0reduce the number of embryos transferred with IVF. \"The relative and absolute numbers of twins in the world are higher than they have ever been since the mid-twentieth century, and this is likely to be an all-time high,\" study co-author Christiaan Monden, a professor of sociology at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, said in a statement. \"This is important as twin deliveries are associated with higher death rates among babies and children and more complications for mothers and children during pregnancy, and during and after delivery.\" More women are having children at a later age, which may also partly explain the rise of twin births, because older women are more likely to conceive twins, the authors said. Related: Seeing double: 8 fascinating facts about twins The study researchers analyzed information on twin births from 165 countries between 2010 and 2015. For 112 of these countries, the researchers also obtained information on twin births between 1980 and 1985, which allowed for a comparison between these periods. The researchers found that over the three-decade period, the twin birth rate increased by more than 10% in 74 out of the 112 countries. The increase is mainly due to increases in dizygotic, or fraternal, twins; rates of monozygotic, or identical, twins have remained about the same worldwide, with about 4 identical twin births per 1,000 deliveries. On a continent level, North America saw the biggest rise in twin births, with a 71% increase in the rate of twin births over the three-decade period, followed by Europe, with a 58% rise, and Oceania, with a 46% rise.  —Can animals give birth to identical twins, triplets or even quadruplets? —Identical twins don\\'t share 100% of their DNA —The riddle of twin telepathy Africa has the highest rates of twins worldwide, with about 17 twin births per 1,000 deliveries; but the rate remained mostly unchanged throughout the three-decade study period. It\\'s thought that some populations in Africa may be more genetically prone to having twins, compared with populations in other parts of the world. \"In both periods, Africa had the highest twinning rates and there was no significant increase over time. However, Europe, North America and the Oceanic countries are catching up rapidly,\" Monden said. But there is a large difference in the chances of survival for twins born in wealthy countries versus low-income countries. \"More attention needs to be paid to the fate of twins in low- and middle-income countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, many twins will lose their co-twin in their first year of life, some two to three hundred thousand each year,\" study co-author Jeroen Smits, a professor of comparative economic and human development at Radboud University in the Netherlands, said in the statement. The researchers call for better tracking of twin births, particularly in lower income countries, as reliable data are lacking for many of those areas, which is the main limitation of the study. Future studies are needed to determine if rates of twinning have indeed peaked in high income countries; and how increases in medically-assisted reproduction in low and middle income countries will affect the rates of twins in those areas.

       "  'Title': \"'Powerful, maybe even frightening' woman with diadem may have ruled in Bronze Age Spain\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Archaeologists in Spain have discovered \"one of the most lavish burials of the European early Bronze Age\": the grave of an elite woman wearing a silver diadem in what might be one of Western Europe\\'s first palaces. She might even have been a queen of sorts who ruled over the realm. The woman\\'s remains were buried next to a man who was slightly older and died a few years earlier, the researchers found. But the man had far fewer and inferior goods in his grave, raising questions about which individual had more power and whether she was a ruler, according to the study, which was published online Thursday (March 11) in the journal Antiquity. When interpreting such a burial, it\\'s important to have an open mind about the past, said study co-researcher Roberto Risch, a professor of archaeology at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. \"Traditionally, in a very male-dominated academia, you would say, \\'Oh, she is the partner of him. He was the big guy — he is a little bit older, and if she is the partner, she is just a beautiful woman and she gets a lot of ornaments,\" Risch told Live Science. But given that she outlived the man and still received more opulent goods, it\\'s likely that the woman had power of her own, Risch said. \"What she is wearing — it\\'s not because of him, because she is alone,\" Risch said. \"There is no more him around. He died before.\" Related: 6 times that showed us women from antiquity were totally badass Archaeologists have known about this site — known as La Almoloya, in the southeastern region of Murcia, Spain — since the 1800s, when Belgian mining engineers discovered the ruins of a Bronze Age society there. This economically tiered society, known as El Argar (2200 B.C. to 1550 B.C.), was complex; the Argaric people built monumental structures, grew and processed cereals such as barley and wheat, kept domesticated animals, traded with faraway cultures and practiced metallurgy, according to a 2020 study published in the journal PLOS One.   Over the millennia, grave robbers have pilfered countless El Argar burials. So archaeologists were stunned in August 2014, when they unearthed a pit burial containing a large ceramic pot that held the remains of two individuals — a man who died when he was 35 to 40 years old and a woman who died when she was 25 to 30 — who were buried in the governing hall of a palatial building. Radiocarbon dating showed that they both died in the mid-17th century B.C., but that the man died a few years before the woman; the burial was later reopened for her interment when she died, Risch said. Testing of the ancient DNA at the Max Planck Institute in Germany showed that the man and women were not biologically related but that they had a 12- to 18-month-old daughter buried in a nearby building. A forthcoming study of the daughter\\'s burial will investigate why she was not buried with her parents, said study co-researcher Cristina Rihuete Herrada, a professor of archaeology at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.  The woman was buried wearing the silver diadem, beaded necklaces, silver-crafted rings, bracelets, spiral hairpieces and earplugs with spirals. The inclusion of a silver-rimmed drinking cup suggests that \"apparently, she was so noble that her lips are not allowed to touch the drinking pot. The pot is covered with silver foil, so her lips only touch[ed] silver,\" Risch said. A silver-handled awl for making holes in textiles suggests that she had power over linen production, a thriving industry based on the looms found at La Almoloya, he said. The man was buried with a beaded necklace, gold earplugs with silver spirals, copper bracelets, silver spiral hairpieces and a copper-bladed dagger. The burial also had a bowl and animal offerings. The burial\\'s silver, most of it hers, weighs about half a pound (230 grams). To put this burial\\'s riches into context, this amount of silver was enough to pay 938 daily wages or buy more than 7,300 lbs. (3,350 kilograms) of barley at that time, the researchers said.    Of the 29 treasures found in the burial, the silver diadem is the most valuable; it\\'s one of only six ever found from Bronze Age Spain. Diadems are often interpreted as symbols of rank that were worn by leaders, the researchers wrote in the study. This particular type of diadem — with a flat, mushroom-like circle on the front — could be worn facing upward or downward. (Archaeologists have found it both ways in burials.) The silver diadem is now corroded, but \"to have a woman looking at your eyes with a shiny mirror that looks into you … She must have been quite somebody,\" Risch said. \"The look of this woman must have been very powerful, maybe even frightening.\" \"The look of this woman must have been very powerful, maybe even frightening.\" This diadem likely signified that the woman was part of the dominant ruling class, just like crowns found in other Bronze Age societies, including the Wessex culture in what is now the southern U.K. and the Únětice culture in what is now Central Europe, Rihuete Herrada said. Moreover, other burials from the El Argar culture show that upper-class women were often buried with posh, gender-specific goods, often starting at about age 6, while men weren\\'t given this honor until about age 12, Rihuete Herrada told Live Science. This suggests that \"girls would acquire this gender status earlier than boys,\" she said. But it\\'s an ongoing question of what gender meant in the El Argar society. In the case of this tomb, \"we have class and gender working together,\" Rihuete Herrada said. So, were the woman\\'s diadem and other treasures emblems of power, or merely burial ornaments? The researchers are leaning toward the former, they said. \"In the Argaric society, women of the dominant classes were buried with diadems, while the men were buried with a sword and dagger. The funerary goods buried with these men were of lesser quantity and quality,\" they said in a statement. \"As swords represent the most effective instrument for reinforcing political decisions, El Argar dominant men might have played an executive role\" in maintaining order, but perhaps the women were the ones making the political decisions, they said. Next, the researchers plan to study marks left by muscles on the El Argar\\'s people\\'s bones to see how they handled the division of labor, Rihuete Herrada told Live Science. An analysis of the skeletons found in the ceramic pot revealed both had marked health conditions. The man had a healed head injury and bone wear and tear that likely came from extensive horseback riding. —Photos: Viking warrior is actually a woman —Photos: Prehistoric village holds Bronze Age treasures —In photos: Early Bronze Age chariot burial Meanwhile, the woman had several congenital conditions, including a missing neck vertebra and rib, two fused lower vertebrae and a short left thumb, as well as rib markings that might indicate a heart infection. \"She would have a shorter neck; she would have a special thumb. If you couple that with all these jewels that transform her aspect, that would add to her singularity amongst that community,\" Rihuete Herrada said. The public will be able to see the artifacts from the burial and other El Argar sites, as well as a virtual 3D Bronze Age settlement with goggles, in Mula and Pliego, Spain, once pandemic restrictions lift, Risch said.

       "  'Full Article': 'About 1,600 years ago, a woman in eastern Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) was buried with a treasure trove of precious objects, including a headdress and four silver buckles that were inlaid with gold and studded with semiprecious stones. Archaeologists with the East Bohemian Museum in Hradec Králové, Czech Republic, found the fifth-century burial in 2019, and they recently described their initial findings in a statement. One exceptional find was the headdress, decorated with golden discs. Glass beads, a bone comb, a ceramic pot and an iron knife also lay near the remains. Five other graves at the burial site contained skeletons, but looters picked them clean of any precious artifacts, plundering the corpses soon after burial. Only a handful of mundane funerary objects in those graves, such as knives and a sword, were untouched, the scientists reported. Related: Image gallery: Ancient treasure trove discovered in Russia Researchers estimated that the woman was between 35 and 50 years old when she died. They identified pieces of fabric on the silver buckles that belonged to two different textiles; one was likely the article of clothing that the buckles clasped together, and the other may have been a coat or cloth that covered the woman\\'s body at the funeral. The scientists also detected traces of leather and fur on the buckles, possibly from another garment. Analysis of the ceramic pot revealed chemical traces of certain fats and acids, suggesting that it was used for cooking and storing meat. All of the people in the graves were between 16 and 55 years old when they died, but most of the skeletons were so badly damaged by looters that it was impossible to determine the sex of the individuals. However, close examination of individual bones did reveal some clues about the health of the deceased people. \"In one individual, traces of cancer were found on the skull and pelvis,\" the researchers said in the statement.

Other chemical analyses of the bones could tell scientists what these people were eating and if their diets changed dramatically during their lifetimes. The researchers also expect \"significant results from the DNA analysis,\" which will be conducted with scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany, and the Institute of Archaeology and Museology at Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic, according to the statement. \"Perhaps we will learn more about the kinship of the dead and where they came from,\" the scientists said.

       "  'Full Article': 'Daylight saving time begins again on Sunday, March 14, when most Americans will move their clocks forward by an hour. On Nov. 7, 2021, daylight saving time (sometimes erroneously called daylight savings time) will end again and we\\'ll set our clocks back by an hour in those regions that observe DST. These fall and spring clock changes continue a long tradition started by Benjamin Franklin to conserve energy. Here\\'s a look at when daylight saving time starts and ends during the year, its history, why we have it now and some myths and interesting facts about the time change. Related daylight saving time coverage: Historically, daylight saving time (DST) has begun in the summer months and ended right before winter, though the dates have changed over time as the U.S. government has passed new statutes, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO). Starting in 2007, DST begins in the U.S. on the second Sunday in March, when people move their clocks forward an hour at 2 a.m. local standard time (so at 2 a.m. on that day, the clocks will then read 3 a.m. local daylight time). Daylight saving time then ends on the first Sunday in November, when clocks are moved back an hour at 2 a.m. local daylight time (so they will then read 1 a.m. local standard time). In 2021, DST begins on March 14 and ends on Nov. 7 in the U.S., when you\\'ll set the clock back an hour and the cycle will begin again. Daylight saving time in the U.S. will begin again on March 13, 2022, according to timeanddate.com. Benjamin Franklin takes the honor (or the blame, depending on your view of the time changes) for coming up with the idea to reset clocks in the summer months as a way to conserve energy, according to David Prerau, author of \"Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time\" (Thunder\\'s Mouth Press, 2005). By moving clocks forward, people could take advantage of the extra evening daylight rather than wasting energy on lighting. At the time, Franklin was ambassador to Paris and so wrote a witty letter to the Journal of Paris in 1784, rejoicing over his \"discovery\" that the sun provides light as soon as it rises. Even so, DST didn\\'t officially begin until more than a century later. Germany established DST in May 1916 as a way to conserve fuel during World War I. The rest of Europe came onboard shortly thereafter. And in 1918, the United States adopted daylight saving time. Though President Woodrow Wilson wanted to keep daylight saving time after WWI ended, the country was mostly rural at the time and farmers objected, partly because it would mean they lost an hour of morning light. (It\\'s a myth that DST was instituted to help farmers.) And so daylight saving time was abolished until the next war brought it back into vogue. At the start of WWII, on Feb. 9, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt re-established daylight saving time year-round, calling it \"War Time.\" Related: 5 crazy chapters in the history of daylight saving time After the war, a free-for-all system in which U.S. states and towns were given the choice of whether or not to observe DST led to chaos. And in 1966, to tame such \"Wild West\" mayhem, Congress enacted the\\xa0Uniform Time Act. That federal law meant that any state observing DST — and they didn\\'t have to jump on the DST bandwagon — had to follow a uniform protocol throughout the state in which daylight saving time would begin on the first Sunday of April and end on the last Sunday of October. Then, in 2007, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 went into effect, expanding the length of daylight saving time to the present timing. Fewer than 40% of the world\\'s countries observe daylight saving time, according to timeanddate.com. However, those who do observe DST take advantage of the natural daylight in the summer evenings. That\\'s because the days start to get longer as Earth moves from the winter season to spring and summer, with the longest day of the year on the summer solstice. During the summer season in each hemisphere, Earth, which revolves around its axis at an angle, is tilted directly toward the sun. Related: Read more about the science of summer.  Regions farthest away from the equator and closer to the poles get the most benefit from the DST clock change, because there is a more dramatic change in sunlight throughout the seasons. Research has also suggested that with more daylight in the evenings, there are fewer traffic accidents, as there are fewer cars on the road when it\\'s dark outside. More daylight also could mean more outdoor exercise (or exercise at all) for full-time workers. The nominal reason for daylight saving time has long been to save energy. The time change was first instituted in the U.S. during World War I, and then reinstituted again during WW II, as a part of the war effort. During the Arab oil embargo, when Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) stopped selling petroleum to the United States, Congress even enacted a trial period of year-round daylight saving time in an attempt to save energy. But the evidence for energy savings is slim. Brighter evenings may save on electric lighting, said Stanton Hadley, a senior researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who helped prepare a report to Congress on extended daylight saving time in 2007. But lights have become increasingly efficient, Hadley said, so lighting is responsible for a smaller chunk of total energy consumption than it was a few decades ago. Heating and cooling probably matter more, and some places may need air-conditioning for the longer, hotter evenings of summer daylight saving time. Hadley and his colleagues found that the four weeks of extra daylight saving time that went into effect in the United States in 2007 did save some energy, about half of a percent of what would have otherwise been used on each of those days. However, Hadley said, the effect of the entire months-long stretch of daylight saving could very well have the opposite effect. A 1998 study in Indiana before and after implementation of daylight saving time in some counties found a small increase in residential energy usage. Temporary changes in Australia\\'s daylight saving timing for the summer Olympics of 2000 also failed to save any energy, a 2007 study found. Part of the trouble with estimating the effect of daylight saving time on energy consumption is that there are so few changes to the policy, making before-and-after comparisons tricky, Hadley told Live Science. The 2007 extension of daylight saving time allowed for a before-and-after comparison of only a few weeks\\' time. The changes in Indiana and Australia were geographically limited. Ultimately, Hadley said, the energy question probably isn\\'t the real reason the United States sticks with daylight saving time, anyway. \"In the vast scheme of things, the energy saving is not the big driver,\" he said. \"It\\'s people wanting to take advantage of that light time in the evening.\" Most of the United States and Canada observe DST on the same dates with a few exceptions. Hawaii and Arizona are the two U.S. states that don\\'t observe daylight saving time, though Navajo Nation, in northeastern Arizona, does follow DST, according to NASA. And, every year there are bills put forth to get rid of DST in various states, as not everyone is keen on turning their clocks forward an hour. In 2018, Florida\\'s Senate and House passed legislation called the Sunshine Protection Act (a PDF of the legislation) that would ask the U.S. Congress to exempt the state from the federal 1966 Uniform Time Act. If approved, Florida would remain in DST year-round. In order to allow Florida\\'s year-round DST, however, the U.S. Congress would have to amend the Uniform Time Act (15 U.S.C. s. 260a) to authorize states this allowance, according to The New York Times. Congress has yet to approve the legislation, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported. Fifteen other states have made similar moves with laws, voter initiatives and resolutions. These states include: Arkansas, Alabama, California, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, according to a statement from the office of U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.). In the fall of 2018, California voted in favor of Proposition 7 that would attempt to repeal the annual clock changes. Next, the state legislature needs to vote on the proposition, followed by the Congress, according to an article on Vox. However, none of that happened, because the federal government didn\\'t approve the time change, San Diego\\'s CBS8 reported. Nine of Canada\\'s 10 provinces observe daylight saving time. The provinces and territories in Canada that stay on standard time all year include: Some regions of the province of British Columbia, \\xa0parts of Saskatchewan, northwest Ontario and east Quebec, according to timeanddate.com. \\xa0Meanwhile, Yukon made DST permanent in 2020. The locations in British Columbia that don\\'t use DST include: Chetwynd, Creston, Dawson Creek, Fort Nelson and Fort St. John; in Saskatchewan, only Creighton and Denare Beach observe DST, according to timeanddate.com. Most of Europe currently observes daylight saving time, which begins at 1 a.m. GMT on the last Sunday in March — that\\'s March 28, 2021, when Europeans move their clocks ahead one hour at 1 a.m. GMT. Daylight saving time ends (winter time) at 1 a.m. GMT on the last Sunday in October, or Oct. 31, 2021, when clocks are moved back an hour. Most European countries observe DST, with the exception of Russia, Iceland and Belarus, according to timeanddate.com. In the United Kingdom, DST is called British Summer Time (BST). DST is called Central European Summer Time (CEST) in: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Spain and Switzerland. Daylight saving starts at 2 a.m. local time for these countries, when clocks are moved ahead an hour to 3 a.m. The same 2 a.m. clock change is followed for Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania, which call DST Eastern European Summer Time (EEST). During summers in Ireland, DST is called Irish Standard Time (IST) and it begins at 1 a.m. local time, when clocks are moved ahead an hour to 2 a.m. The same clock change occurs in the Canary Islands, the Faroe Islands and Portugal, which call DST Western European Summer Time (WEST).However, even the European Union may propose an end to clock changes, as a recent poll found that 84% of 4.6 million people surveyed said they wanted to nix them, the Wall Street Journal reported. If the lawmakers and member states agree, the EU members could decide to keep the EU in summer time or winter time, according to the WSJ. The DST-observing countries in the Southern Hemisphere — in Australia, New Zealand, South America and southern Africa — set their clocks forward an hour sometime during September through November and move them back to standard time during the March-April timeframe. Australia, being such a big country (the sixth-largest in the world), doesn\\'t follow DST uniformly: New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory follow daylight saving, while Queensland, the Northern Territory (Western Australia) do not, according to the Australian government. Clocks in the observing areas spring forward an hour at 2 a.m. local time on the first Sunday in October —which is Oct. 3, 2021 — and push back an hour at 3 a.m. local daylight time on the first Sunday in April — or April 4, 2021.

       "  'Title': 'Physicists measure the tiniest gravitational force ever',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Physicists have measured the smallest gravitational field ever recorded, in an experiment that could help in the search for a unified theory of physics. Of the four fundamental forces known to physics — the weak and strong interactions, the electromagnetic force and the gravitational force — only gravity remains unintegrated into the playbook of physics called the Standard Model, which describes how the zoo of subatomic particles behaves. Gravity is instead described by Einstein\\'s general theory of relativity, but as this breaks down at the quantum scale, our best picture of the universe is left divided in two. As a result, physics still can’t describe how gravity works at subatomic scales, leaving physicists scratching their heads when it comes to understanding the singularities that lie in the centers of black holes, or why gravity is so much weaker in strength than all of the other forces. Related: Quantum Gravity Could Reverse Cause and Effect But a new experiment that measured the miniscule gravitational attraction between two tiny gold spheres, each spanning just 2 millimeters across, could be the first of many to provide clues to how gravity operates at these scales. \"This was a proof-of-concept experiment to create a sensor capable of measuring very small accelerations and to establish methods that would allow us to detect even smaller gravitational forces,\" study co-author Jeremias Pfaff, a doctoral student at the University of Vienna, told Live Science. \"Long-term, we\\'d like to answer what the gravitational field of a quantum object in a superposition looks like, but there is a lot to be done on the way there,\" said Pfaff, referring to the gravity experienced by a subatomic particle that is in two quantum states at once. To get a peek at how gravity works at small scales, the researchers used a tiny version of a torsion balance — a device first devised by English scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798 to measure the density of the Earth, and from it the strength of the gravitational constant called G. A torsion balance is a horizontal bar suspended from its center by a wire with two masses, in this case gold spheres, attached to each end. This means that if a tiny force is applied along the horizontal axis of the bar, the wire will twist and scientists can measure the applied force \\xa0based on how much the bar has rotated. By bringing a third gold sphere into close proximity with one of those attached to the end of the bar, the researchers were able to measure the force of gravity between it and the attached sphere. The force the researchers were looking for was tiny. At about 9 × 10^minus 14 newtons, it would be the force that one-third of a human blood cell would experience in Earth\\'s gravitational field. So the experiment needed to be incredibly sensitive, and the researchers had to minimize exposure to outside noise, make sure that no stray charges built up on the apparatus, and find a way to spot the desired signal. \"The urban environment is also far from ideal,\" said Pfaff. \"It was stunning to see that we are not only sensitive to small earthquakes, but also to the local tram and single buses. We were even able to see the Vienna city marathon in our data.\" They got rid of any stray charges by flooding the area surrounding the apparatus with ionized nitrogen before placing it in a vacuum. They also made the tiny gravitational signal they were searching for stand out more by moving the two spheres closer and farther apart ever-so-slowly. In much the same way that a blinking light is more noticeable than a constant one, the growing and shrinking gravitational force between the spheres was much easier to pick out than if they were stationary. This allowed the researchers to find the strength of the gravitational force between the two spheres, and also find their own measurement for the gravitational constant. — The 18 biggest unsolved mysteries in physics — Strange quarks and muons, oh my! Nature\\'s tiniest particles dissected — 8 Ways you can see Einstein\\'s theory of relativity in real life So far, at the scale they were measuring, gravity followed the same predictable rules it does at larger scales. The physicists are now hoping to make their experiment even more sensitive so they can pick up smaller signals from masses at least 1,000 times lighter and at shorter distances. This could provide important clues to a theory that explains gravity at both small and large scales, along with insights into other mysteries like the existence of dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that emits no light yet exerts gravitational pull. At smaller scales, the researchers could begin to detect completely new ways that matter interacts through gravity — ways that follow the much more bizarre rules of the quantum world. If they do, physics might finally start to bridge the gap between our big and small pictures of the universe. \"Expanding our knowledge on this elusive force might help us gather hints to find a more fundamental understanding of our physical reality,\" Pfaff said.

By just popping on some VR goggles, you could be the Egyptologist who enters the tomb to explore its depths. Egyptology experts at the University of California Berkeley have created \"The Book of the Dead in 3D,\" which uses VR to offer a rare first-person glimpse of an Egyptian burial site. Its 3D environments and reconstructions of artifacts present an up-close perspective on traditions surrounding the deities, demons, and magic spells of death and the afterlife in ancient Egypt, University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) representatives said in a statement.

Three years later, Hearst donated the lid to the collection of what is now called UC Berkeley\\'s Phoebe Apperson Hearst Museum of Anthropology, according to the website for The Book of the Dead in 3D. Psamtik served as the pharaoh\\'s head physician as well as \"chief of the Libyans\" — a type of overseer of foreign mercenaries, according to the Hearst Museum. But the Doctor was never laid to rest in his sarcophagus, which was empty when the tomb was discovered (though a coffin in a nearby chamber held a woman thought to be Psamtik\\'s wife). To this day, why Psamtik\\'s mummy wasn\\'t found there remains a mystery, the Hearst Museum says. In addition to Psamtik\\'s sarcophagus lid, Lucarelli and her colleagues have scanned, digitized and 3D-modeled Egyptian artifacts from the Hearst Museum and other collections in California since 2015. Their goal is to preserve ephemeral objects in a digital format, and to ensure that objects will remain available for academic study and research even after repatriation to their countries of origin, according to the statement. Using VR video-game technology adds fun and excitement to the tours, \"but my main aim is for this project to be strong academically and useful for scholars,\" Lucarelli said in the statement. \"The Book of the Dead in 3D\" immersive interactive will launch in 2021 at the Hearst Museum, according to the statement.

       "  'Full Article': 'Global warming will change the lengths of the four seasons, a new study suggests, potentially making six-month-long summers the norm in the Northern Hemisphere by the year 2100. In contrast, winters could last less than two months a year, while spring and autumn similarly shorter. These drastic seasonal changes would have wide-reaching impacts on the world, disturbing agriculture and animal behavior, increasing the frequency of heat waves, storms and wildfires, and ultimately posing \"increased risks to humanity,\" the study authors wrote. \"Tropical mosquitoes carrying viruses are likely to expand northward and bring about explosive outbreaks during longer and hotter summers,\" the researchers wrote in their study, published Feb. 19 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Related: 10 Steamy signs that climate change is speeding up These and other potential impacts \"heighten the urgency of understanding\" how the seasons morph with climate change, and whether that transformation will continue in the future. To find out, the study authors looked at historical daily temperature data from 1952 to 2011 in the Northern Hemisphere. Specifically, they wanted to see how the onset of new seasons changed from year to year. The team defined the start of summer as the onset of temperatures in the hottest 25% of temperatures, averaged from 1952 to 2011. They defined winter as the start of temperatures in the coldest 25% from the same period, while autumn and spring were in between. The researchers found that, on average, summer lengthened from 78 to 95 days between 1952 and 2011. Meanwhile, winter shrank from 76 to 73 days. The transition seasons shrank as well, with spring shortening from 124 to 115 days and autumn from 87 to 82 days. Average temperatures changed accordingly during this period; summer and winter both became warmer.

Under the business-as-usual scenario (that is, if no efforts are made to mitigate global warming), spring and summer will start a month earlier in 2100 than they did in 2011, while fall and winter will start half a month later. As a result, the Northern Hemisphere will spend more than half the year in summer — and average summer temperatures are only expected to rise. This seasonal shift would impact everything from when birds migrate to when crops grow, touching virtually every aspect of Earth\\'s biosphere, the team wrote.

       "  'Full Article': 'A European spacecraft is unraveling the secrets of the weird long cloud that has been appearing again and again in the Martian sky \\xa0for years. The Arsia Mons Elongated Cloud is a peculiar feature on Mars: a long, bright water ice cloud stretching out over the Martian surface, extending over the planet\\'s Arsia Mons volcano all the way to the volcano Olympus Mons, the tallest mountain in the solar system. The strange phenomenon has been recurring every year around Mars\\' southern solstice, with the cloud forming and fading daily for 80 or more days at a time on the Red Planet. However, while the cloud is no new presence, it is challenging to observe in its entirety because of the changing Martian atmosphere and the difficulties of observing from orbit. Still, the European Space Agency\\'s Mars Express orbiter has managed to get an in-depth look at the peculiar cloud using a special tool: the Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC), perhaps better known by its nickname the Mars Webcam. In a new study, astronomers using this data are gleaning new details about the long cloud, including how big it can really get and details of the intricate dynamics at play in the climate system surrounding it. Photos: Red Planet views from Europe\\'s Mars Express  The VMC was originally installed to spot the Beagle 2 lander, a British Mars lander that was declared lost and is speculated to have crashed. \"However, recently, the VMC was reclassified as a camera for science,\" Jorge Hernández Bernal, an astronomer at the University of the Basque Country in Spain and lead author of this new study of the cloud who also is part of a long-term project studying the cloud, said in a statement. \"Repurposing the VMC has successfully enabled us to understand this transient cloud in a way that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise,\" ESA\\'s Mars Express project scientist Dmitrij Titov said about the VMC in the same statement.  The tool allows scientists to \"track clouds, monitor dust storms, probe cloud and dust structures in the Martian atmosphere, explore changes in the planet’s polar ice caps, and more,\" Titov added. For this study, astronomers used both the VMC observations and data from other Mars Express instruments in addition to data from other missions including NASA\\'s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), the Viking 2 missions and the Indian Space Research Organization\\'s Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM). \"We were especially excited when we dug into Viking 2’s observations from the 1970s,\" Bernal said. \"We found that this huge, fascinating cloud had already been partially imaged that long ago — and now we’re exploring it in detail.\" Mars Illusion Photos: The \\'Face on Mars\\' and Other Martian Tricks  The researchers found that, at its largest, the cloud measures out to be about 1,118 miles (1,800 kilometers) long and 93 miles (150 km) across. The cloud is \"orographic,\" meaning it forms when wind is pushed upward by surface features like mountains (in this case, Arsia Mons), and is the largest cloud of this type ever seen on the planet. The cloud is also highly dynamic, they found, forming before sunrise then expanding rapidly for two and a half hours. It can grow at a mind-boggling speed of \\xa0over 373 mph (600 kph) before it stops expanding. It then detaches from where it formed and is stretched even more before evaporating in the late morning. On Earth, orographic clouds are never as big as this Martian cloud, nor as dynamic, making it especially strange. Now that the researchers have better handle on the life cycle and patterns of this phenomena, it will enable them to more easily target and observe the cloud. \"Many Mars orbiters cannot begin observing this part of the surface until the afternoon due to the properties of their orbits, so this really is the first detailed exploration of this interesting feature — and it’s made possible by not only Mars Express’ diverse suite of instruments, but also its orbit,\" study co-author Agustin Sánchez-Lavega, the science lead for the VMC and a professor of physics at the University of the Basque Country, said in the same statement.

       "  'Full Article': 'A secret medieval tunnel has been discovered near the site of a soaring 12th-century Abbey in Wales. Electrical workers from Western Power Distribution (WPD) in Wales accidentally discovered the tunnels while digging a hole for a new powerline pole in a customer\\'s backyard in Monmouthshire, near the English border. The human-made tunnel system is 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall and is situated alongside a brook that runs through the village of Tintern and the Wye Valley. There is no record of the tunnels ever being built, and the archaeologists who have now examined them aren\\'t sure what they were used for or how far they stretch underground. Related: 12 bizarre medieval trends \"Shortly after the excavation work began, the digging team made the extraordinary discovery of what they initially thought to be a cave,\" Allyn Gore, a WPD technician who was involved in the discovery, said in a statement. \"I have been involved in other excavations where we have discovered old wells and cellars not shown on any plans, but nothing as exciting and impressive as this.\"  The power company has now rerouted maintenance work away from the tunnels to allow for an archaeological investigation that could take years to complete, according to the WPD statement. The tunnels aren\\'t shown on any maps of the area created by the ordnance survey — the national mapping agency of the U.K. — that date back to the 18th century, according to WPD. \"Before work began, all the usual checks and permissions were in place,\" Gore said in the statement. \"Nothing had shown up on any of our drawings or records to indicate there was anything unusual about the site.\" The tunnels also run underneath a footpath in the village, so residents have been walking on top of tunnels for centuries without realizing it. The tunnels could be linked to the nearby Tintern Abbey, which was built by Cistercian monks in 1131 and is considered a \"national icon\" of Wales and a \"gothic masterpiece,\" according to Cadw (the Welsh Government\\'s historic and cultural heritage service). The Abbey fell into ruin after King Henry VIII\\'s dissolution of the monasteries in 1536, so if the tunnels were part of the Abbey this could explain why there are no surviving records of the tunnels.

       "  'Title': 'US Air Force is guarding against electromagnetic pulse attacks. Should we worry?',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'A U.S. Air Force base in Texas has taken the first steps to guard against an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack. But what, exactly, is an EMP, and how big is the threat? Officials at the Joint Base San Antonio in Lackland, Texas, issued a request for bids to carry out a survey of a facility called the Petroleum, Oil and Lubrication Complex. The survey will identify any equipment that could be vulnerable to an EMP ahead of more detailed vulnerability testing, according to the request. After that, officials would figure out ways to keep that equipment safe in the event of an EMP attack. Related: The 22 weirdest military weapons An EMP is a massive burst of electromagnetic energy that can occur naturally or be generated deliberately using nuclear weapons. While many experts don\\'t think EMPs pose a big threat, some people argue that these types of weapons could be used to cause widespread disruption to electricity-dependent societies. \"You can use a single weapon to collapse the entire North American power grid,\" said defense analyst Peter Pry, who served on the Congressional EMP Commission, which was set up to assess the threat of EMP attacks but shut down in 2017. \"Once the electric grid goes down, everything would collapse,\" Pry told Live Science. \"Everything depends on electricity: telecommunications, transportation, even water.\" According to the request, the testing at Lackland comes in response to a 2019 executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump for the federal government to strengthen its infrastructure against EMPs. Pry, who has consulted on the project, said the survey and resulting upgrades are part of a broader initiative by the U.S. Air Force to beef up its defenses against this type of threat. An EMP releases huge waves of electromagnetic energy, which can act like a giant moving magnet. Such a changing magnetic field can cause electrons in a nearby wire to move, thereby inducing a current. With such a huge burst of energy, an EMP can cause damaging power surges in any electronics within range. Related: Doomsdays: Top 9 real ways the world could end These pulses can occur deliberately or naturally. Natural EMPs occur when the sun occasionally spits out massive streams of plasma, and if they come our way, Earth\\'s natural magnetic field can deflect them. But when the sun spits out enough plasma at once, the impact can cause the magnetic field to wobble and generate a powerful EMP. The last time this happened was in 1859 in the so-called Carrington Event, and while electronics were still rare then, it knocked out much of the recently built telegraph network. Then, there\\'s the possibility of deliberate EMPs. If a nuclear weapon were to be detonated high in the atmosphere, Pry said, the gamma radiation it would release could strip electrons from air molecules and accelerate them at close to the speed of light. These charge-carrying electrons would be corralled by Earth\\'s magnetic field, and as they zipped around, they would generate a powerful, fluctuating electric current, which, in turn, would generate a massive EMP. The explosion could also distort Earth\\'s magnetic field, causing a slower pulse similar to a naturally occuring EMP. Setting off a nuclear weapon about 200 miles (300 kilometers) above the U.S. could create an EMP that would cover most of North America, Pry said. The explosion and radiation from the bomb would dissipate before reaching ground level, but the resulting EMP would be powerful enough to destroy electronics across the region, Pry said. \"If you were standing on the ground directly beneath the detonation, you wouldn\\'t even hear it go off,\" Pry said. \"The EMP would pass harmlessly through your body.\" A small EMP with a radius of under a kilometer can also be generated by combining high-voltage power sources with antennas that release this energy as electromagnetic waves. The U.S. military has a cruise missile carrying an EMP generator. Called the Counter-Electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP), it can be used to target specific enemy facilities, and Pry said it would be within the capabilities of many militaries, or even terrorist groups, to build an EMP generator. \"We\\'ve arrived at a place where a single individual can topple the technological pillars of civilization for a major metropolitan area all by himself armed with some device like this,\" he said. The technology required to protect against EMPs is similar to what is already used to prevent damage from power surges caused by lightning, Pry said. These technologies would have to be adapted to deal with higher voltages, but devices such as surge protectors, which divert excess voltage into the Earth, or Faraday cages, which shield devices from electromagnetic radiation, could do the job. Pry said the EMP Commission estimated it would cost $2 billion to $4 billion to protect the most important pieces of equipment in the national grid, but ideally, he would like to see standards changed so that EMP protection is built into devices. The threat posed by EMPs is far from settled, though. A 2019 report by the Electric Power Research Institute, which is funded by utility companies, found that such an attack would probably cause regional blackouts but not a nationwide grid failure and that recovery times would be similar to those of other large-scale outages. —Apocalypse now: The gear you need to survive doomsday —The top 10 ways to destroy planet Earth —End of the world? Top 10 doomsday threats Frank Cilluffo, director of Auburn University\\'s McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security, said that, while an EMP attack would certainly be devastating, it\\'s unlikely that the United States\\' enemies would carry out such a brazen assault. \"There are other ways that adversaries can achieve some of the same outcomes, some of which would be cheaper and some of which would be less discernible,\" Cilluffo told Live Science. Such alternatives might include cyberattacks to take out critical infrastructure, including the electric grid, or even efforts to disrupt space-based communications or the GPS system that modern society is so reliant on. Work to protect against EMPs makes sense, particularly given the possibility of another Carrington-like event, but these upgrades shouldn\\'t distract from efforts to shore up defenses against more probable lines of attack, Cilluffo said.

On the surface of the strip of parchment — called a \"birthing girdle\" or \"birth scroll\" — the researchers found traces of plant and animal proteins from medieval treatments used to treat common health problems during pregnancy, and of human proteins that match cervico-vaginal fluid. Those traces suggest the girdle was worn by women while they gave birth. \"This particular girdle shows visual evidence of having been heavily handled, as much of the image and text have been worn away,\" biochemist Sarah Fiddyment of the archaeology department at the University of Cambridge told Live Science in an email. \"It also has numerous stains and blemishes, giving the overall appearance of a document that has been actively used.\" Related: 12 bizarre medieval trends Fiddyment is the lead author of the new study, which was published on Wednesday (March 10) in the journal Royal Society Open Science. The long and narrow parchment was originally made, probably in the late 15th century, from four strips of sheepskin that had been scraped thin and stitched together. The resulting strip is illustrated with Christian imagery, including pictures of the nails of the crucifixion; the holy monogram IHS, which is a way of writing Jesus\\' name; a standing figure, possibly Jesus; and his crucifixion wounds, dripping with blood. The text of Christian prayers also appears on both sides.  The birthing girdle described in the study is a rare surviving example held in the Wellcome Collection, a museum and library of science, medicine, life and art in London. Such girdles were once commonplace as magical remedies to protect women from the dangers of childbirth, which was a leading cause of death for women in the medieval period. There are several references to their use in medieval England, and churches and monasteries often loaned them out to pregnant women in return for a donation; when the wife of the English king Henry VII became pregnant, the sum of six shillings and eight pence was paid \"to a monke that brought our Lady gyrdelle to the Queen,\" according to historic records. Women would wear the scrolls of illustrated parchment or silk wrapped around their waist and pregnancy bump in one of several configurations; the scrolls were about 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide and just about exactly 11 feet (3.3 m) long — it was thought that such a girdle would fit Mary, the mother of Jesus. Related: The top 10 most controversial miracles But birthing scrolls and other church rituals were targeted for destruction during Henry VIII\\'s so-called \"Dissolution of the Monasteries\" that began in 1536. Protestant reformers considered the rituals of childbirth as \"sanctuaries for forbidden religious practices,\" and they actively tried to suppress them — although recalcitrant midwives continued to use birthing girdles on the sly, wrote the researchers. \"One of the great anxieties of the Reformation was the adding of aid from supernatural sources beyond the Trinity,\" study co-author Natalie Goodison, a historian at the universities of Durham and Edinburgh, explained in an email. \"The birth girdle itself seems to have been particularly worrisome, because it seems to harness both ritualistic and religious powers.\"  The researchers made a non-invasive examination of the birthing girdle by applying dampened small disks of plastic film to its surface, so that chemical traces from a material are transferred onto the disk — a technique that has been used previously to study fragile paper documents and even ancient mummified skin. Their tests showed traces of proteins from honey, cereals, legumes — such as beans — and milk from sheep or goats, which are all ingredients from medieval treatments for childbirth and its associated health problems. For example, beans were said to heal lesions of the womb and to start the flow of breast milk; and milk from goats was thought to give strength after blood loss, a frequent occurrence in childbirth, wrote the researchers. The researchers also found traces of 55 human proteins on the parchment of the birth scroll, but only of two on a control sample of parchment that was known not to have been used in childbirths. The proteins on the birthing parchment were overwhelmingly those found in human cervico-vaginal fluid, the researchers wrote: \"This can provide a further possible indication that the role was indeed actively used during childbirth.\" —Photos: Hidden text discovered in England\\'s oldest Bible —8 truly dysfunctional royal families —8 archaeological sites that Jesus may have visited This particular birthing girdle dates to as far back as the early 15th century, and it was either forgotten or quietly stored away during the Dissolution of the Monasteries about 60 years later. It is now one of only a few birthing girdles to have survived that initial purge and the fluctuations of power between subsequent Catholic and Protestant monarchs of England who influenced birthing practices during their reigns, including the use of birthing girdles. \"If it was employed by midwives on the sly, it could have been used for 150 years, but we think that the longer date is less likely,\" Goodison said. \"The very fact that this manuscript is so obviously worn indicates that it was very well used. … My impression is that it was used in hundreds of deliveries.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Why were dozens of people butchered 6,200 years ago and buried in a Neolithic death pit?',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Around 6,200 years ago, 41 people in what\\xa0is now Croatia were killed and buried in a mass grave, and members of their own community may have murdered them, according to new analysis of the remains. Adult men and women were among the dead, but ages in the group ranged from 2 years old to 50 years old, and about half of the skeletons belonged to children. Many of the killing blows were strikes to the skull that landed from behind, and there were no marks on the arm bones that indicated the victims tried to defend themselves from their attackers, scientists reported in a new study. Genetic analysis showed that about 70% of the deceased were not closely related to other victims, but all shared common ancestry. Researchers suspect that the massacre may have been prompted by a sudden population boom or shift in climate conditions that depleted resources and led to indiscriminate mass murder. Related: 25 grisly archaeological discoveries The grave was discovered in 2007, when a man who lived in a small village in the hills of Potočani, Croatia, was digging a foundation for a garage, and heavy rains exposed a pit holding dozens of skeletons. Archaeologists with the University of Zagreb happened to be conducting a survey nearby, and they were able to start investigating the mass grave on the day it was discovered, said Mario Novak, lead author of the new study and head of the Laboratory for Evolutionary Anthropology and Bioarchaeology at the\\xa0Institute for Anthropological Research in Zagreb, Croatia. The pit is small, measuring about 6.5 feet (2 meters) in diameter and 3 feet (1 m) deep, and at least 41 bodies had been unceremoniously dumped there. At first, the archaeologists thought that the remains were modern, either from World War II or the Croatian War of Independence in the 1990s, Novak told Live Science. But there were no contemporary objects in the pit — just fragments of pottery that looked to be prehistoric. And when researchers inspected the victims\\' teeth, they found no dental fillings. Radiocarbon dating of bones, soil and pottery fragments confirmed the age of the burial, dating it to around 4200 B.C. The researchers identified 21 of the victims as children between the ages of 2 years and 17 years old, and 20 as adults between 18 years and 50 years old; 21 of the dead were male and 20 were female.  But how did they end up buried together? For the new study, Novak and his colleagues sampled DNA from remains and analyzed the bones of 38 individuals. When the researchers inspected the bodies, they found that most had at least one traumatic injury at the back of the skull, and some skulls had as many as four punctures. Mass graves in medieval Europe frequently contained people of all ages and sexes who succumbed to the Black Death, but the victims in the Potočani pit died by violence, not of infectious disease, Novak explained. \"The only plausible scenario was a massacre,\" he said. Distribution of men and women, and of adults and children, was roughly equal, and there were no wounds to their limbs or faces, so they likely weren\\'t killed in a skirmish during combat. It is unknown if the victims were restrained or otherwise incapable of defending themselves — \"if someone attacks you with a club or a sword, you reflexively raise up your forearm to protect the head,\" which would have left at least some remains with cut marks on the arm bones, Novak said. \"But we didn\\'t see any facial injuries, and no defensive injuries whatsoever.\"  – Back to the Stone Age: 17 key milestones in Paleolithic life – In Photos: The Life and Death of Ancient \\'Urbanites\\' – Photos: 5,000-year-old Neolithic figurine Genetic data showed that only 11 of the victims were close relatives, so the massacre wasn\\'t targeting a specific family group. Neither did it look like a planned discriminatory killing, in which foes tended to murder older men while taking women captive. \"In this case, it was just random killing, without any concern for sex and age,\" Novak said. A Neolithic death pit that was recently described in Spain also held a jumble of skeletons — male and female, young and old. DNA showed that the victims were recent arrivals to the region, so they may have been slaughtered by locals protecting their territory, Live Science previously reported. But genetic evidence from the site in Potočani indicated that even though most of the dead weren\\'t closely related, they shared common ancestry. This means that they weren\\'t newcomers; rather, they came from a local population that was homogenous and stable, \"so we can exclude that this massacre was associated with the influx of new immigrants,\" Novak said. The most likely explanation is one that archaeologists and climatologists have suggested for other ancient massacre sites in Germany and Austria dating to about 5,000 years ago, in which adults and children were also killed indiscriminately and thrown into shallow mass graves. In those scenarios, prolonged climate change that caused flooding or droughts — perhaps combined with an unexpected population boom — could have led to squabbles over precious resources. And in Potočani, one of those struggles turned deadly. \"By studying such ancient massacres, we might try to get a glimpse into the psychology of these people, and maybe try to prevent similar events today,\" Novak said. \"We have evidence of ancient massacres going back to 10,000 years ago, at least. Today, we also have modern massacres — the only thing that\\'s changed is we now have more efficient means and weapons to do such things. But I don\\'t think human nature or human psychology has changed much.\" The findings were published online March 10 in the journal PLOS One. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': 'Songbirds are dying across parts of California and the Pacific Northwest, and officials think crowds at bird feeders are to blame, according to recent news reports. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and wildlife rehabilitation centers have been \"inundated\" with calls since December 2020 from California residents reporting that they found sick or dead finches at their bird feeders, according to a statement posted Feb. 8. An investigation into the deaths revealed that the birds were infected by the Salmonella bacteria and had developed salmonellosis. A tale as old as (pandemic) time: large gatherings were to blame. Related: Photos: Birds evolved from dinosaurs, museum exhibit shows Finches who came into contact with food, water or objects contaminated with feces from infected birds can contract the illness, according to the statement. As more birds gather in an area such as a bird feeder or a bird bath, the risk of infection increases. Most birds die within a day of being infected, Krysta Rogers, an avian disease specialist with the CDFW, said in the statement. Almost all of this year\\'s outbreak were reported in places with bird feeders. The outbreak especially affected pine siskins (Spinus pinus), a species of finch that\\'s small, brown with a sliver of yellow, streaked and very chatty (Its calls sound like a \"like a zipper being zipped,\" according to ebird.org.) But lesser goldfinches (Spinus psaltria), American goldfinches (Spinus tristis) and others were also affected. Most of these salmonellosis cases were along the Central Coast, in the San Francisco Bay Area and in the Sierra Nevada. Infected birds look lethargic, puffed or fluffed up with partially closed eyes (and sometimes with swollen, red or irritated eyes), according to Sonoma County\\'s Bird Rescue Center. — Photos of the world\\'s largest flying bird — Of a feather: Photos reveal stunning birds of the southwest — In Photos: Birds of prey \"Salmonellosis occurs periodically in pine siskins in some winters throughout their range,\" Rogers said in the statement. However, this year\\'s outbreak is particularly bad because it\\'s an \"irruption year\" of pine siskins. There\\'s a lot of pine siskins that have traveled south due to a shortage of seeds in Canada, according to the Bird Rescue Center of California\\'s Sonoma County and The National Audubon Society. Because pine siskins can spread the bacteria, salmonellosis outbreaks are often correlated with irruption years, according to the Bird Rescue Center. If you find a sick or dead bird, officials recommend contacting your local wildlife rescue center immediately.\\xa0They also recommend keeping young children or free-roaming cats and dogs away from infected equipment or dropped seeds. But \"the very best way\" to stop the birds from spreading the bacteria is to remove the bird baths and feeders so that the birds can spread out and feed on natural vegetation, according to The Bird Rescue Center. The Center \"strongly recommends\" removing the feeders and birdbaths from your yard until next spring when the Pine Siskins migrate north once again. But the outbreak isn’t solely contained to California, dead and sick birds are also turning up in the Pacific Northwest. The Washington state Department of Fish and Wildlife has\\xa0also urged people\\xa0to take down their bird feeders until at least April 1.

       "  'Full Article': 'Archaeologists in Sweden have discovered nearly two dozen gold foil figures that have engravings of couples embracing each other. The figures, which date back about 1,300 years, were found in the remains of a great hall on a platform mound, a human-made structure, at the site of Aska in Sweden. The researchers are still trying to piece together the broken figures to uncover more about them. \"Our best estimate is that we have 22 foil figures. The exact number is not quite clear because most are fragmented, and there is some uncertainty as to which fragments go together,\" Martin Rundkvist, an archaeology professor at the University of Lodz in Poland, wrote in a report recently uploaded to academia.edu, a site where researchers can upload papers. The report has not been published in a peer reviewed journal. Related: 25 most mysterious archaeological finds on Earth Despite being broken, the fragments had some order to them. \"When found, many pieces were folded up more or less neatly,\" and a goldsmith named Eddie Herlin unfolded them for the archaeologists, Rundkvist wrote. An image in the report shows that one of the folded up figures has its edges folded towards the center. The task of unfolding the gold figures required the support of a specialist like Herlin who was able to unfold the figures without damaging them. After the team unfolded the pieces, it became clear that all of the gold figures had depictions of couples embracing. It\\'s not clear who the embracing couples are. While gold foil figures have been found at other sites in Sweden, there are no surviving written accounts of them, Rundkvist said. \"You typically find\\xa0lots of different figures on one site, suggesting that they were brought by visitors from lots of different places as gifts,\" Rundkvist said. \"They are commonly found in and around postholes in large feasting halls. They were probably glued to the posts supporting the roof and anchoring the king\\'s high seat.\" —7 bizarre ancient cultures that history forgot —10 epic battles that changed history —30 of the world\\'s most valuable treasures that are still missing One possibility is that the embracing couples are gods and goddesses. \"We do know that kings at the time claimed divine descent,\" Rundkvist said. Or, they may depict princes and princesses who were about to get married, Rundkvist said. In addition to the engraved gold figures, the archaeologists found the remains of two game pieces made out of whale bone, as well as three iron pendants with spiral patterns. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the hall and its platform were constructed sometime between A.D. 650 and A.D. 680, \\xa0and archaeological work shows that the hall was eventually dismantled in an organized fashion, one radiocarbon date suggests that this may have taken place around A.D. 940. There is no sign of any violent destruction and the site may have been dismantled by those who used it. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': 'Tiny snowflakes of radioactive uranium that trigger massive nuclear blasts might explain some of the universe\\'s more mysterious star explosions. As smallish stars die, they cool into husks of their former selves known as white dwarfs. New research proposes that atoms of uranium sink to the centers of these aging white dwarf stars as they cool, freezing into snowflake-like crystals no bigger than grains of sand. There, these \"snowflakes\" can act as some of the tiniest nuclear bombs in the universe, becoming the \"spark that sets off the powder keg,\" said study co-author Matt Caplan, a theoretical physicist at Illinois State University. \"It\\'s important to understand how these explosions occur for all sorts of applications, from the production of elements to the expansion of the universe,\" Caplan told Live Science. Related: Big Bang to the present: Snapshots of our universe through time These unusually dim star explosions are part of a class known as Type Ia supernovas. Typically, scientists think these explosions occur when a white dwarf star reaches a critical mass after siphoning gas from a companion star the white dwarf is in orbit with. Because Type Ia supernovas explode when they reach the same mass, they have the same brightness. This uniform brightness allows them to be used as a standard by which t distances in the universe are measured. However, astronomers have noticed some Type Ia supernovas that are slightly dimmer than they should be. The new research, accepted to the journal Physical Review Letters, proposes an explanation in which lower-mass white dwarfs without a binary star companion can explode as supernovas on their own —even without sipping mass from a nearby star. \"Maybe we don\\'t need the companion,\" study co-author Chuck Horowitz, a theoretical nuclear astrophysicist at Indiana University, told Live Science. \"Maybe a single star on its own can explode.\" White dwarfs are the remnant cores of stars less than 10 times the mass of the sun. Having shed their outer layers, white dwarfs are cold, unburning balls of mostly carbon and oxygen with a few other elements, such as uranium, sprinkled in. As they slowly cool over hundreds of thousands of years, their atoms freeze, with the heaviest atoms — like uranium — sinking to the core and solidifying first. Traditionally, scientists thought these white dwarfs, when solo, eventually dwindled into cold, dark husks. But in some cases, this process could set the stage for a massive nuclear-bomb-like explosion, the scientists said. When sunken uranium atoms bump into one another, they freeze, forming tiny radioactive snowflakes. Within an hour of the snowflake\\'s formation, a rogue passing neutron in the core could smash into the snowflake, triggering fission — the nuclear reaction in which an atom is split. This fission could set off a chain reaction, similar to that in a nuclear bomb, eventually igniting the rest of the star and causing the white dwarf to explode as a supernova all by itself. Related: The 12 strangest objects in the universe For this chain reaction to happen, however, there needs to be plenty of the radioactive isotope uranium-235. Because this isotope decays naturally over time, this type of explosion is only possible in the biggest stars, which have the shortest life spans. Smaller stars, such as the sun, some 5 billion years in the future when it dies, wouldn\\'t have enough uranium-235 left for such explosions by the time they became white dwarfs. The new paper has been met with interested skepticism by some scientists. —15 unforgettable images of stars —How long do stars live? —Cosmic record holders: The 12 biggest objects in the universe \"If it works, it would be a really interesting way to do it,\" Ryan Foley, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told Live Science. However, Foley noted that dim Type Ia supernovas tend to come from old populations of stars, not those with mostly younger stars, where this type of explosion would occur. \"Among young stars, there are very few,if any, dim Type Ia supernovae,\" Foley said. While the research has shown that this new mechanism is physically possible, it\\'s not clear yet if these solo star explosions really happen, how often they happen and exactly how the fission that fuels them is triggered. \"Right now, we\\'re eager to run simulations to see if the snowflakes can really ignite the fission chain reaction to explode the star,\" Caplan told Live Science. \"Even if it didn\\'t fully ignite, it would be interesting to see if there is a fizzle or weak burning in the core.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': 'Paul M. Sutter is an astrophysicist at SUNY Stony Brook and the Flatiron Institute, host of Ask a Spaceman and Space Radio, and author of How to Die in Space. He contributed this article to Space.com\\'s Expert Voices: Opinions and Insights. Astronomers continue to find potentially habitable worlds around small, red stars. But those worlds are almost certainly tidally locked, with one side of the planet constantly facing its star. This poses a severe challenge to the possibility of life on these alien planets, but new research suggests a way to more evenly cool those planets: ocean currents whipping around the worlds faster than they rotate. Related: 10 exoplanets that could host alien life We\\'re finding tons of exoplanets out there. With NASA\\'s Kepler mission (whose databases are still fruitful after the space telescope\\'s death), the agency\\'s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and scores of ground-based missions, astronomers are discovering world after world orbiting distant stars. The ultimate goal: find an Earth-like planet orbiting a sun-like star at just the right distance so that the heat the planet receives from its star is just enough to melt ice, but not too hot to boil it away. This is the \"habitable zone,\" the region around every star where liquid water can stay nice and liquid. And while we haven\\'t yet found an exact copy of Earth, we have come close: planets roughly the size of our own, orbiting within the habitable zone, but around small, red dwarf stars. On one hand, this is amazing, because red dwarfs are by far the most common kind of star in the galaxy, and so there must be scores of planets in a multitude of habitable zones. But on the other hand, it\\'s kind of frustrating, because of something known as tidal locking. When a small object orbits close to a large object (like, say, the moon around Earth or a planet around a star), the bigger object will raise tides on the smaller one. (Technically, the smaller object also raises tides on the bigger object, but they\\'re not nearly as major and we don\\'t need to worry about that now.) With those extra tidal lumps, the smaller object will slowly develop a lopsided preference: instead of getting any old rotation it wants, it will end up \"locking.\" This locking forces the rotation of the small object to match its orbit around the larger one. You can see the results of this just by looking at the full moon: since the moon is tidally locked to Earth, it always presents the same face to us, and it wasn\\'t until the space age that we were able to get a glimpse of its backside. Related: How exoplanet habitable zones work Tidal locking is bad news for life. If you\\'re on a planet orbiting a red dwarf star, its light is so weak that you need to be smashed right up against that star to get in its habitable zone. Close enough that you\\'ll get tidally locked. That means one side of the planet will constantly face the sun, while the other will be locked in permanent midnight. So, even though on average the temperatures of the planet may be peachy-keen, one side will be too hot and the other too cold. Unless there\\'s a way to transport heat from the hot side to the cool side. Because of Earth\\'s tilt, our planet is unevenly heated by the sun, and in response it tries to balance everything out through wind and ocean currents, which constantly carry heat from one place to another. But in order to efficiently transport heat on a tidally locked planet, those currents have to super-rotate — they have to move faster than the rotation of the planet itself, if they have any chance of warming up the night side and cooling off the day side. Super-rotation is already well known in planetary atmospheres. The atmosphere of Venus, for example, whips around the surface every four Earth days, while the surface itself takes a lazy 243 Earth days to complete a single rotation. Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, probably has a super-rotating atmosphere. It even happens on Earth: high-altitude winds above the equator are occasionally capable of super-rotation. Super-rotating atmospheres are great and all, but the real deal when it comes to heat transport isn\\'t air but water. If a tidally locked exoplanet truly wants to stay mild, its ocean currents better move fast. That\\'s exactly what a new study, recently appearing on the preprint journal arXiv, set out to examine. And that study has some good news to report: depending on the conditions, tidally locked exoplanets are capable of oceanic super-rotation. According to the study, the super-rotation in the alien oceans is initially driven by strong winds, then amplified by deep-water waves in the oceans. Those waves, known as Kelvin and Rossby waves, are common to any ocean on a rotating planet, including Earth, where they are responsible for the formation of giant pressure systems and jet streams. On a tidally locked planet, the same physics apply, and these waves amplify each other to drive massive currents of water, faster than the planet itself rotates. The researchers found that these super-rotating currents are only possible at the equator, and naturally this can be messed up by a variety of unknown factors. If there\\'s a big enough continent in the way, for example, it can stop the current dead in the tracks. If the planet is tilted or has too shallow of an ocean, that can also prevent the super-rotation from occurring. But still, super-rotation of ocean currents on tidally locked exoplanets is certainly possible, which is a relief for any hopes and dreams of alien life on those exoplanets. The more their atmospheres and oceans can transport heat around those worlds, the better chance life has for thriving.

       "  'Title': 'The moon has a tail, and Earth wears it like a scarf once a month',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Like a comet soaring through the cosmos, the moon is followed by a slender tail of irradiated matter — and Earth passes directly through it once a month. According to a study published March 3 in the journal JGR Planets, the lunar tail is made of millions of sodium atoms blasted out of the lunar soil and into space by meteor strikes and then pushed hundreds of thousands of miles downstream by solar radiation. For a few days a month, when the new moon sits between Earth and the sun, our planet\\'s gravity drags that sodium tail into a long beam that wraps around Earth\\'s atmosphere before blasting into space on the opposite side. The lunar tail is harmless and invisible to the naked eye. During those few new-moon days each month, however, the beam becomes visible to high-powered telescopes that can detect the faint orange glow of sodium in the sky. According to the study\\'s authors, the beam then appears as a fuzzy, glowing spot in the sky opposite the sun, about five times the diameter of the full moon and 50 times dimmer than human eyes can perceive. Researchers first detected this \"sodium spot\" in the 1990s. But while the spot always appears at the same time in the lunar cycle, its brightness fluctuates wildly. To understand why, the authors of the new study used an all-sky camera (which can parse the faint wavelengths of light given off by specific elements, like sodium) to take some 21,000 images of the moon, from 2006 to 2019. They noticed a few predictable patterns — for example, the spot appeared brighter when the moon\\'s orbit brought it closer to Earth — but also an unexpected one. Meteor data showed that the moon\\'s tail glowed more brightly during months when the rate of sporadic meteors (that is, meteors that aren\\'t part of a regular shower) was higher over Earth. When Earth gets pummeled by meteors, so does the moon. And sporadic meteor encounters had an even greater correlation with the moon spot\\'s brightness than recurring showers, such as the Leonid meteor shower, which peaks every November. — 15 unforgettable images of stars — The 15 weirdest galaxies in our universe — \\xa0The 12 strangest objects in the universe The reason for this? It may be that sporadic meteors have the potential to be faster, larger and more energetic than their counterparts in predictable showers, the study authors suggested. Meteors that slam into the moon with more force are more likely to blast large amounts of sodium higher into the atmosphere, the researchers said, creating a larger swarm of atoms for the sun\\'s photons (electromagnetic particles) to collide with and push toward Earth. If a large enough asteroid crashed into the moon with enough force, it could even produce a sodium spot that anyone on Earth could see with the naked eye, James O\\'Donoghue, a planetary scientist at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, told The New York Times. (O\\'Donoghue wasn\\'t involved in the research, but he did make the above lunar-tail animation for the research team.) In the meantime, we\\'ll have to be content with the knowledge that, once a month, our companion in the sky showers Earth with a pinch of cosmic pixie dust.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Your brain warps your memories so you can remember them better',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Like a fisherman talking about the size of the one that got away, the brain exaggerates its memories. This exaggeration is in the service of good, however. New research finds that when people exaggerate the differences between similar memories, they recall them better. The findings could help explain why memory works, and why it often declines with age. The research involved asking people to match faces to objects, which often differed only slightly in color. When people mentally exaggerated the color differences between the objects, they were better at recalling which face went with which object. Brain imaging showed that this exaggeration was tied to activity in a region of the brain called the lateral parietal cortex. \"It\\'s very fascinating to me to see that memory distortions can actually help us to tell these similar memories apart,\" said Yufei Zhao, the lead author of the study and a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Oregon. Zhao and her colleagues had previously conducted research on the hippocampus, a curved region deep in the brain that sits above the brainstem and is important for initially encoding memories. Brain imaging studies had shown some differences in how the hippocampus handled memories of two very similar events, but it wasn\\'t clear whether there were any changes to the content of the memory itself. In the new study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience on Feb. 22, Zhao and her co-authors focused on a part of the brain that doesn\\'t encode memories but rather helps to recall them: the lateral parietal cortex, which sits beneath the top back of the skull. \"Parietal cortex is actually the place where the memory is housed when we retrieve our memory,\" Zhao told Live Science. \"You will hold your memory in your parietal cortex, so investigating the parietal cortex can give us a very nice window to look at the details of our memory.\" There were 29 participants in the study. On day one of the study, the participants were shown 24 different faces, each associated with a different everyday object, such as a beanbag, hat, balloon or umbrella. Unbeknownst to the participants, the researchers had chosen the objects so that they could later be paired up in a recall test. In half of the cases, these pairs were made up of two different objects — a balloon and a hat, perhaps — that were subtly different in color, just 24 degrees apart on a color wheel. In the other half of cases, the pairs were made up of the same objects — two beanbags — only different because their shades were also 24 degrees apart on the color wheel. One might be light green and the other darker green, for example. Two beanbags of slightly different color shades should be harder for the brain to remember than a balloon and a hat in those same shades, the researchers reasoned. Thus, if the brain distorts memories to remember them better, the participants should have exaggerated the gap between the colors of same-object pairs more than the gap between the colors of different-object pairs. On day two of the study, the participants tested their recall. They were shown a picture of a face and the object associated with that face in grayscale. They then had to pick the color of the object on a color wheel. Sure enough, the participants exaggerated the gap in colors in the same-image condition but did not do so in the different-image condition. This exaggeration was also associated with accuracy, the researchers found. The participants were better at remembering which face went with the correctly colored object when they exaggerated the color differences between the same-object pairs. Then, the study authors tracked brain activity using \\xa0functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which detects changes in oxygenation correlated with blood flow within the brain. Areas with more blood flow are more active. The researchers found differences in the patterns of activation in a wrinkle in the parietal cortex called the ventral intraparietal sulcus. These differences were focused in a region that encodes information about shape and color, and were more pronounced when the participants were recalling same-object pairs versus different-object pairs, meaning that the differences correlated with the exaggerations in the color gaps in people\\'s memories. — 10 ways to keep your mind sharp — Top 10 mysteries of the mind — 10 everyday things that cause brain farts \"The neural pattern actually remembers them as less similar to each other, Zhao said. That dissimilarity is then correlated with better memory performance, she added. Similar memories interfere with each other, becoming difficult to recall clearly (for example, it\\'s easier to remember the one time you parked your car at Disneyland than one of the hundreds of times you parked at your office parking garage). The finding explains one way the brain reduces interference between similar memories, she said. Most likely, she said, this interference reduction starts in the hippocampus, where the brain may initially weigh the differences between two memories heavily in order to differentiate them. For example, if you went to the beach on two different days but one day was windy and the other was calm, the hippocampus might make special note of the weather difference when encoding the memory. Then, when you recall the memory, the parietal cortex may exaggerate the windiness of one day and the stillness of the other so that you retrieve the right day. The participants in the study were all young, healthy adults with good memory recall, Zhao said — they were 98.9% accurate at recalling face-object matches when the objects were different and 93.2% accurate at remembering the matches when the objects were the same. The next step, she said, is to study older adults. Memory performance declines with age, Zhao said, and one reason might be that the brain becomes less skilled at reducing interference between memories. The researchers now want to find out if the brains of older adults fail to exaggerate the differences between their similar memories. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': \"Rare meteorite, a 'relic of the early solar system,' falls on a driveway in England\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'A meteorite found in the U.K. contains an extremely rare combination of minerals that could give scientists a glimpse into how the solar system formed and even how life emerged on Earth. The meteorite tumbled to Earth on Feb. 28, when a dazzling fireball zoomed over southwest England, Live Science previously reported. At the time, scientists suspected that quite a few fragments of the space rock likely reached the ground. One such fragment landed on a driveway in Winchcombe, a town in Gloucestershire, according to a statement from the Natural History Museum in London. Noticing a black, sooty splotch on their driveway, the house\\'s occupants bagged up bits of the meteorite and quickly alerted the U.K. Meteor Observation Network, which then contacted the Natural History Museum. Related: Crash! 10 biggest impact craters on Earth \"For somebody who didn\\'t really have an idea what it actually was, the finder did a fantastic job in collecting it,\" Ashley King, a researcher at the museum who studies meteorites, said in the statement. \"He bagged most of it up really quickly on Monday morning, perhaps less than 12 hours after the actual event. He then kept finding bits in his garden over the next few days.\" It\\'s important to collect fallen meteorites soon after they hit the ground, since they can quickly become contaminated by rain or exposure to the atmosphere, Live Science reported. In all, the collected fragments weigh almost 11 ounces (300 grams) and represent the first bits of fallen space rock recovered in the U.K. since 1991, according to the museum statement. Upon examining the rocky fragments, the museum researchers identified the meteorite as a carbonaceous chondrite, a rare type of meteorite that originates from an ancient asteroid forged in the early days of the solar system when the first planets formed. \"Meteorites like this are relics from the early solar system, which means they can tell us what the planets are made of,\" Sara Russell, a researcher at the museum who studies carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, said in the statement. \"But we also ... think that meteorites like this may have brought water to the Earth, providing the planet with its oceans.\" The meteorite itself looks a bit like coal but is much softer and more fragile, King said in the statement. The texture hints that the space rock contains soft clay minerals and, therefore, once contained water ice. In general, carbonaceous chondrite meteorites usually contain a mix of minerals and organic compounds, including amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. —The 7 strangest asteroids: Weird space rocks in our solar system —Space-y tales: The 5 strangest meteorites —When space attacks: The 6 craziest meteor impacts \"It is almost mind-blowingly amazing, because we are working on the asteroid-sample-return space missions Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx, and this material looks exactly like the material they are collecting,\" Russell said in the statement. Both these spacecrafts were designed to intercept and collect samples from asteroids; Hayabusa2 returned to Earth in 2020, bearing 0.16 ounces (4.5 grams) of space rock, and OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to deliver about 2.1 ounces (60 grams) of samples in 2023, according to the statement. But thanks to the Winchcombe meteorite, the museum researchers now have more than 10 ounces (280 grams) of carbonaceous chondrite to study. The minerals likely survived their fall to Earth because they descended relatively slowly, striking the ground at 28,800 mph (46,800 km/h), the researchers noted. While that may sound fast, meteorites can reach speeds of up to 154,800 mph (252,000 km/h) as they streak through the atmosphere — a rate that would cause carbonaceous chondrite to disintegrate before it ever hit the ground, King said in the statement. In regard to the Winchcombe meteorite, \"the fact that it was going quite slowly, and then that it was collected so quickly after landing, avoiding any rainfall that could change its pristine composition, means that we\\'ve just really lucked out with everything,\" she said.

       "  'Title': \"Universe's oldest known quasar discovered 13 billion light-years away\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Astronomers have discovered the most distant and ancient single source of radio emissions in the known universe. That source is one of the universe\\'s most powerful particle accelerators: a quasar 13 billion light-years from Earth spewing jets of particles at nearly the speed of light. Quasars are some of the oldest, most distant, most massive and brightest objects in the universe. They make up the cores of galaxies where a rapidly spinning supermassive black hole gorges on all the matter that\\'s unable to escape its gravitational grasp. While the black hole is devouring this matter, it\\'s also blasting out an enormous amount of radiation that collectively can be more than a trillion times more luminous than the brightest stars, making quasars the brightest objects in the observable universe. Related: The 12 strangest objects in the universe \"[G]iven that these objects are so luminous, they can be observed very far away,\" Chiara Mazzucchelli, who led the discovery together with Eduardo Bañados, told Live Science. \"When galaxies like the Milky Way are too faint to be detected and studied at these distances, we can use these very luminous quasars to study when the universe was very young. We\\'re talking about a time when the first stars and galaxies formed.\" This quasar in particular, named P172+18, is a relic from around 780 million years after the Big Bang and reveals clues about one of the earliest ages of the universe — the epoch of reionization. At the start of this period, the universe was darkly veiled by a mostly uniform cloud of hydrogen gas. Scientists refer to this time as the universe\\'s dark ages, because most light emitted was quickly absorbed by the neutrally charged gas. Eventually, gravity collapsed the primordial gas into the first stars and quasars, which began to heat and ionize the surrounding gases, allowing light to pass through. Mazzucchelli, an astronomer at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, and Bañados, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, first spotted the quasar while using the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. They observed the telltale radio signature left by powerful jets of particles erupting from above and below the black hole. The superspeedy particles emit a tremendous amount of \\xa0radio waves. Scientists call these quasars \"radio-loud\" and believe their jets of accelerated particles, which are seen only in about 10% of quasars, play a pivotal role in the evolution of early galaxies. Further observations from telescopes, including the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Very Large Telescope in Chile, showed that P172+18 is nearly 300 million times more massive than the sun and is among the fastest-growing quasars ever discovered. The problem is, scientists don\\'t know how a black hole became so massive this early on in the universe. The radio jets could be an explanation. —10 huge black hole findings from 2020 —The brightest quasar of the early universe shines with the light of 600 trillion suns —How galaxies are classified by type (infographic) \"Theoretical studies say that the presence of radio jets can increase the speed of which the black hole eats matter, which means that they can allow for a black hole to grow much faster and might explain why [the black holes] are so massive so early,\" Mazzucchelli said. \"At the same time, radio jets may also impact the galaxy surrounding the quasar by influencing how stars form.\" However, the black hole\\'s feeding frenzy may not have lasted long. When the astronomers compared their most recent observations to a survey of the sky taken more than two decades before, they discovered that the quasar had lost half its brightness, signaling that the quasar was possibly reaching the last stages of its life. Mazzucchelli described quasars as distant flashlights that illuminate a specific time and space in the universe\\'s history. Each new quasar discovered reveals another patch in the timeline between the Big Bang and the universe we see today. She\\'s hopeful that the research team will find many more nearby quasars in the future. In fact, not long after their discovery of P172+18, the astronomers found a second beacon of radio waves nearby. If further observations confirm that this companion radio source lies at the same distance as the quasar, it could be the most distant pair of active galaxies ever discovered. The researchers hope telescopes such as NASA\\'s James Webb Space Telescope will be able to determine the radio source\\'s exact distance. The researchers\\' findings will be published in a forthcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': 'The British royal family is plenty familiar with scandals and depravity, from Prince Charles\\' affair with his current wife Camilla Parker Bowles, to Prince Harry being photographed wearing a Nazi costume to the extreme coldness and racism alluded to in the Oprah Winfrey interview with Duchess Meghan Markle, wife of Prince Harry. But\\xa0a great number of kings and queens throughout history have been complicit in evil-doings and just bad choices, including palace assassinations and serial marriages. Castle walls have seen it all. 1. Cleopatra\\'s bloody beginning  Cleopatra is famous for her suicidal ending. What\\'s less known is her bloody beginning — and the familial drama that brought her to power. After her father\\'s death, Cleopatra\\'s younger brother Ptolemy XIII inherited the throne. She was meant to marry him, inbreeding being one way ancient royal families kept a grip on power. But her ambitions threatened him, and he had her exiled, according to Stacy Schiff\\'s \"Cleopatra\" (Little, Brown and Company, 2010). So Cleopatra allied with Julius Caesar, retaking the throne with her other younger brother, Ptolemy XIV. That younger brother later died; Cleopatra may have poisoned him. She also had her younger sister Arsinoe IV, another rival, killed in 41 B.C. Deadly sibling rivalry was common in the Ptolemy dynasty, according to Schiff. The complex family trees occasioned by inbreeding caused succession crisis after succession crisis, typically with deadly results. \"It was rare to find a member of the family who did not liquidate a relative or two,\" Schiff wrote. 2. Macedonian mayhem  Another surefire way to rile up a royal family is to have lots and lots of wives, all of which would like to see their own children installed on the throne. Alexander the Great\\'s father, Philip II of Macedon, probably had seven wives, including Alexander\\'s mother, Olympias. Olympias may have had something to do with Philip II\\'s assassination by a bodyguard in 336 B.C., according to some ancient historians, but the truth is fuzzy. According to a later account by the historian Cleitarchus, the bodyguard was a former lover of Philip II, who had taunted the king\\'s new, younger, lover into suicide. Philip II\\'s uncle-in-law allegedly sexually assaulted the bodyguard in retaliation, leading the bodyguard to kill Philip II in his own quest for revenge. Whatever really happened, the Macedonian family dysfunction did not end with Philip II\\'s generation. Alexander quickly started putting rival family members to death to secure his ascension to the throne, and Olympias had Philip II\\'s last wife and her children killed. After Alexander died in 323 B.C., leaving a pregnant wife but no sure heir, his mentally disabled half-brother Philip III Arrhidaios (also spelled\\xa0Arrhidaeus) was installed on the throne. Philip III\\'s wife Eurydice attempted to turn this figurehead king into a real ruler; this put her in competition with Olympias in the ensuing wars of succession. Ultimately, Philip III was executed on Olympias\\' orders, and Eurydice forced to commit suicide. Their bodies were buried and then dug up about 17 months later for a royal cremation and funeral. Olympias would not escape the succession wars unscathed. Captured not long after she had Philip III and Eurydice killed, she was stoned to death by relatives of people she had ordered executed. 3. Murder of a pharaoh  Harems are all fun and games until somebody gets their throat slit, as Ramesses III learned the hard way. This pharaoh ruled Egypt from 1186 B.C. to about 1156 B.C. — until somebody slashed his neck so deeply that modern archaeologists say he would have died instantly. Ancient papyrus texts reveal that one of Ramesses III\\'s minor wives, a woman named Tiye, was behind the plot; she was trying to get her son Pentaweret installed on the throne. Dozens of co-conspirators were sentenced to death, according to contemporary records, including Pentaweret. Archaeologists reported in 2012 they may have found the prince\\'s mummy. The corpse in question has an agonized expression and overinflated lungs, consistent with death by suffocation or strangulation. He may have been forced to commit suicide, or he may have been buried alive. [In Photos: The Mummy of Ramesses III] 4. War of brothers  A conflict called the War of the Two Brothers can signal just one thing — a serious family meltdown. In 1527, the Inca king Huayna Capac died, leaving his kingdom to two of his sons, Atahualpa and Huáscar. (The two men had different mothers, as Inca rulers took multiple wives and concubines.) Joint rule did not work out so well for the two new kings. By 1529, war broke out. Things got personal: According to Kim MacQuarrie\\'s book \"The Last Days of the Incas\" (Simon & Schuster, 2008), Atahualpa at one point made a drinking cup out of the skull of one of Huáscar\\'s generals. The Inca civil war would hurry along the downfall of this civilization. In 1532, Francisco Pizarro\\'s Spanish conquistadors appeared just as Atahualpa was declaring victory over his brother. The conquistadors captured Atahualpa and held him for ransom, though Atahualpa was able to get out an important order to his people: Execute my brother. Atahualpa wouldn\\'t outlive Huáscar by much. The Spanish executed him in 1533. [Related: 10 epic battles that changed history] 5. The passive-aggressive emperor  Ever get the sense Mom and Dad like your brother or sister more? The kids of the Wanli Emperor had no doubt. Wanli, the 13th emperor of China\\'s Ming dynasty, had two official consorts and a great many concubines. His favorite concubine, Lady Zheng, had two sons, one of whom Wanli desperately wanted to follow him on the throne. But the emperor\\'s ministers wouldn\\'t stand for this son — Wanli\\'s third — as heir. Ultimately, they prevailed, and Wanli was forced to declare his first son by his consort Lady Wang the crown prince. And then the emperor did something very strange. He stopped working. Wanli had once been a strong ruler, handling internal rebellions and Japanese invasions with panache. The last 20 years or so of his reign, however, were like an extended lame-duck period. In a passive-aggressive protest, Wanli spent decades ignoring meetings, memorandums and all other royal duties, according to a 2011 article in the New York Times. Unsurprisingly, this undermined the country. Many historians attribute the crumbling of the Ming dynasty in 1644 largely to the self-sabotage of Wanli\\'s rule. 6. Captive brother  William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England, had four sons. One died before him; William split his kingdom for his eldest remaining sons. Robert was given Normandy upon his father\\'s death, and William got the throne of England. That left the youngest son, Henry. He may not have been granted a kingdom, but Henry knew how to grab an opportunity. In 1100, William the younger died in a hunting accident while Robert was away on a crusade. Within three days, Henry had himself crowned king of England (as Henry I), beating his absent brother to the punch, according to the official histories of the British monarchy. Robert attempted to take England for himself, but Henry I beat him back — and then, a few years later, took Normandy, too. Robert was captured, and Henry I kept him imprisoned for the rest of his life. 7. A murder mystery  Richard III, the last Plantagenet king of England, was recently exhumed from underneath a parking lot in Leicester. The occasion was heralded by Richard\\'s fans as an opportunity to better understand a king remembered mostly as a Shakespearian villain. But questions remain about Richard\\'s rise to power. When King Edward IV died in 1483, he left behind two young sons. The eldest, Edward V, was only 12, so Richard III was declared his protector. After a 68-day reign, Edward and his younger brother Richard of Shrewsbury were sent to the Tower of London and then were never heard from again. Meanwhile, Richard III took the throne. No one knows what happened to the boys, now known as \"the Princes in the Tower.\" A widespread theory holds that Richard III had them murdered. But no one has ever found definitive proof of the princes\\' deaths (though two small skeletons were excavated from the tower in 1674), and Richard himself died in battle only two years later, taking his secrets to his hastily dug grave. 8. The many wives of Henry VIII  Divorced, beheaded, died. Divorced, beheaded, survived. Those were the fates of Henry VIII\\'s six wives. Family matters came to dominate the reign of this Tudor king, who could not seem to secure himself a male heir. Originally, Henry married Catherine of Aragon, his brother\\'s widow. When the king\\'s eye roved to the witty Anne Boleyn in the 1520s, his argument for divorce focused largely on whether Catherine had ever had sex with his brother. The divorce case rocked the Catholic Church, triggering the English Reformation. Henry got his divorce, but Anne proved no more able to produce sons than Catherine (some modern physicians suspect that Henry may have had a genetic disorder that caused his wives\\' many miscarriages). She was executed on trumped-up charges of treason, adultery and incest, accused of sleeping with her own brother. Henry would go on to marry four more times and would have one more of his wives, Catherine Howard, killed for adultery. Ultimately, Henry\\'s efforts to install a son on the throne were for naught; his one male heir died as a teenager, only about six years into his reign. Henry\\'s great-niece Lady Jane Grey then took the crown for a mere nine days before being overthrown by his daughter by Catherine of Aragon, Mary I. After Mary I died five years into her reign, Anne Boleyn\\'s daughter Elizabeth I ruled. Her reign was marked by tumult, but Henry\\'s fear that a woman could not hold the throne of England turned out to be quite unfounded: According to the official history of the British Monarchy, the \"Virgin Queen\" was extremely popular, and the date of her accession to the throne became a national holiday.

       "  'Title': 'Magical amulet decoded. It protected owner from blood-sucking spirits.',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'A newly deciphered magical amulet \\xa0claims to stop evil spirits \"who eat flesh and drink blood,\" archaeologists have found. About 1,600 years ago, the Mandaeans, who have lived in southern Iraq and Iran for millennia, wrote the incantation onto a lead amulet in their language Mandaic. When unfolded, the amulet looks like a long thin piece of lead. The discovery could shed light on the Mandaean religion, which is complex and blends together several beliefs. Both John the Baptist and archangel Gabriel are both important figures who practiced the religion. Modern-day Mandaeans often ritually immerse themselves in water as a form of purification, and they follow a pacifist philosophy in which violence cannot be used even in self defense. Related: In photos: Ancient city discovered in Iraq According to the deciphered text, the amulet was meant to protect a man named Abbiya from blood-drinking spirits and a demon. \"In the name of life, may there be health to the spirit and soul of Abbiya, the son of Mahua,\" the translated text says. The amulet calls on Gabriel, who is the \"angel of the gods,\" to \"throw down, bind, strike, kill and fetter the demon.\" It also calls on Gabriel to stop “spirits who eat flesh and drink blood\" from hurting Abbiya. \"From the sons and daughters, may a great voice, healing, victory, sealing, protection, and sealing be to the body and spirit and soul of Abbiya…\" the amulet says. The amulet is about 8 inches long and 1.7 inches wide (20.3 by 4.4 centimeters) and contains 62 lines of writing, Tom McCollough, an emeritus professor of religion at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, said in a presentation recently at the virtual joint annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) and the Society for Classical Studies (SCS). Centre College purchased the unrolled amulet, along with two others, from a collector in 2009 for $5,000. At the time of purchase, the collector said that the amulets were purchased by a family member in Jerusalem in the 1950s, presenting photographs supporting this claim, McCollough said. These photographs are important, as southern Iraq has been looted heavily over the past few decades; and McCollough said that many journals will not publish inscriptions from Iraq unless there is proof that they were not recently looted. Related: 7 biblical sites ravaged by modern-day looters At time of publication, the researchers were unable to share the photographs with Live Science or reveal the identity of the collector. The three amulets are made out of lead and have a copper casing. By analyzing the amount of corrosion on the deciphered amulet, Centre College chemist Jeff Fieberg found it dates to at least A.D. 450 and perhaps earlier, Fieberg said. Used this dating method on another of the amulets purchased from the collector, Fieberg found that it dated to at least A.D. 750. Because the amulets are so old, they can provide clues as to how the religion of Mandaeanism evolved over time, the researchers said. \"The only thing we have from the early period are these magical implements,\" McCollough said.  —Archaeologists are hot on the trail of these 16 spectacular mysteries —7 bizarre ancient cultures that history forgot —Cracking codices: 10 of the most mysterious ancient manuscripts An estimated 50,000 Mandaeans are alive today. For millennia, they were based in southern Iraq and Iran; but they faced persecution during the rule of former Iraq president Saddam Hussein and were targeted by some militant groups after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. As a result, many Mandaeans were forced to flee Iraq, with some now living in the United States, Australia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Canada. Live Science reached out to members of the Mandean community to get their thoughts on the amulet and their religion, though none responded at the time of publication. Research into the amulets is ongoing. Recently, researchers were able to unroll the amulet that dated to A.D. 750 and are in the process of deciphering the writing.

       "  'Title': \"Exotic crystals of 'ice 19' discovered\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Scientists have identified the 19th form of water ice. The exotic, four-sided crystals of this rare ice variety, now dubbed ice XIX, form at ultra-low temperatures and ultra-high pressures. It only exists in laboratory experiments, but researchers say it reveals more about other forms of ice, which can be found deep in the Earth’s mantle and on very cold planets and moons. \"To name a new ice form, one needs to elucidate exactly what the crystal structure is,\" said lead researcher Thomas Loerting, a professor of physical chemistry at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. That means figuring out the simplest repeating structure of the crystal, where all of the atoms are located within that structure, and what the symmetry of the crystal structure is, Loerting said. \"Only if all of these are known, you are allowed to name your ice … Ice XIX is now the name for the new ice phase discovered in our work,\" he told Live Science in an email. An article by Loerting and his colleagues describing the new form of ice was published Feb. 18 in the journal Nature Communications, alongside a study by researchers in Japan who verified the discovery. Related: Snowflake gallery: No two alike, of course Almost everyone is familiar with the beautiful six-sided variety of snowflakes, which mirrors the hexagonal arrangement of oxygen atoms in the crystals of water ice that make them. But regular six-sided crystals of ice — ice I — are actually just one of its many forms, which are known as polymorphs. And until recently, 18 different polymorphs of water ice had been formally identified — although only six-sided ice is common on Earth.Although ice might seem simple, it is complicated stuff. For instance, only the oxygen atoms in the water molecules of six-sided ice crystals form a hexagonal shape, while their hydrogen atoms are randomly oriented around them. This makes ice I a \"disordered\" or \"frustrated\" ice in the terminology of ices. One of the properties of such disordered ices is that they can deform under pressure: \"This is the reason why glaciers flow,\" Loerting said. In contrast, the hydrogen atoms in several of the other polymorphs of ice also have their own crystal patterns, and they are called \"hydrogen-ordered\" or “H-ordered” as a result. Unlike disordered ices, H-ordered ices are very brittle and will shatter, rather than deform, he said. In those terms, the newly identified 19th form of ice is an H-ordered ice; in fact, it\\'s an H-ordered form of a disordered ice, called ice VI, which has a random pattern of hydrogen atoms. And ice VI also has yet another H-ordered polymorph, ice XV, in which the hydrogen atoms are aligned in an entirely different pattern. \"Ice VI, ice XV and ice XIX are all very similar in terms of density [because] they share the same kind of network of oxygen atoms,\" Loerting said. \"But they differ in terms of the positions of hydrogen atoms.\" It\\'s the first time that such a relationship between ice polymorphs has been discovered, and it could allow experiments to study transitions between one form and another, he said.  Loerting\\'s team first made ice XIX in their laboratory experiments three years ago, by slowing the cooling process of ice XV to about minus 170 degrees Celsius (minus 274 degrees Fahrenheit) and greatly increasing the pressure to roughly 2 gigapascals. But the details of its crystal structure eluded them until they were able to study it with a process called neutron diffraction, which can reveal the atomic structure of a material by bouncing a stream of neutrons off it and examining the resulting diffraction pattern. In normal circumstances, neutron diffraction requires swapping out the water in a sample with heavy water that contains extra neutrons. But pure heavy water was impractical for the ice XIX experiments because it freezes much more slowly, Loerting said. The breakthrough was to dose the heavy water with a fraction of regular light water, producing water that froze quickly but still allowed neutron diffraction. — The mysterious physics of 7 everyday things — What\\'s that? Your physics questions answered — Images of melt: Earth\\'s vanishing ice Loerting explained that the structure of water ice is a key to the nature of the hydrogen bond, which is imperfectly understood. It\\'s also important for understanding celestial bodies, such as the ice giants Uranus and Neptune and icy moons of Jupiter (including Europa, Io and Ganymede), where some other ice polymorphs are found. \"It is of great interest in astrophysics to know the density and the properties of the ice phases, to be able to understand the behavior of the icy mantles or icy cores of these celestial bodies,\" he said. And there are still many more polymorphs of ice out there. The discovery of ice XIX makes six ice polymorphs discovered at the University of Innsbruck since the 1980s, and Loerting hopes his team will discover the next one, too. \"The race for ice XX started yesterday, and I hope my research group will be the one to publish it,\" he said. \"Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': \"Saudi Arabia's wants to build a 105-mile-long 'Line' city in the desert\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Saudi Arabia has a bold vision for its newest city: a 106-mile-long (170 kilometers) \"Line\" without cars or long commutes. But urban design experts are skeptical, to say the least. \"Awful. Nightmare,\" said Emily Talen, an urban design researcher at The University of Chicago. Despite the flashy announcement of The Line, the technology for such a city doesn\\'t exist yet, and building massive new cities from scratch is fraught with challenges. \"The history of so-called megaprojects is not pretty,\" said Stephen Wheeler, a landscape architect and environmental design professor at the University of California, Davis. \"Usually, they don\\'t quite turn out the way the original visionaries intend, they often fall prey to economic conditions or other people\\'s ideas of what should happen, or they wind up costing vastly more than expected.\" So far, The Line exists only as a website and a press announcement made by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Jan. 10. The proposal calls for the aforementioned 106-mile strip of development in Neom, a planned city in northwestern Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government touts the area as undeveloped, but it is in fact home to 20,000 members of the Huwaitat (also spelled Howeitat) tribe, who have protested being evicted for the planned megacity, according to The Guardian. The Line would be built in three layers: a surface-level pedestrian layer full of parks and open spaces, a lower \"service\" layer and an even deeper transportation \"spine\" that would consist of \"ultra-high-speed transit.\" The proposal claims that all daily services would be walkable within 5 minutes of each node on the line and that commutes between nodes on the high-speed transit would take no more than 20 minutes. According to some experts, however, those goals are unfeasible. The plan for a miles-long line with a width that can be walked in only 5 minutes is questionable, said Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, a professor of architecture at the University of Miami and a founding partner at DPZ CoDesign, an urban design and architecture firm. To support that level of public transport, Plater-Zyberk told Live Science, the line would require larger nodes capable of holding more people. \"If there\\'s only a few hundred people at every stop, you\\'re not going to economically sustain that investment in that infrastructure,\" she said.  Keeping The Line linear would also require heavy regulation, Plater-Zyberk said, as cities tend to expand outward as they grow. This is why \"hub-and-spoke\" transit systems tend to be more common; they allow arms of transit to connect to one another without requiring travel all the way back to a central transit station. Even as they advance promising ideas such as walkability, The Line\\'s designers seem to dispense with historical knowledge about what works well when designing transit, Plater-Zyberk said. \"There are many people now worldwide who could assist in elaborating the idea to make it workable,\" she said. \"We have data on what kind of support transit systems need in order to be sustainable.\" However, it\\'s also unclear if the technology for The Line\\'s transit system exists yet. Traveling 106 miles in 20 minutes would require a speed of 318 mph (512 km/h), which outpaces high-speed rail by a long shot. Eurostar trains in Europe travel at about 199 mph (320 km/h); and while some of China\\'s high-speed rail trains reach speeds of 236 mph (380 km/h, in practice, they average about the same speeds as Eurostar. Underground Hyperloop pods, like those in development by Virgin and SpaceX, could theoretically manage the journey, but that technology is still at least a decade away from use. The fastest Hyperloop tests so far have topped out at 288 mph (463 km/h) without passengers. Only one company, Virgin, has tested the technology with passengers, at speeds of 107 mph (172 km/h). If the future of tech is a problem for The Line, so is the past. The Saudi proposal isn\\'t the first time a linear city has been suggested. In 1882, Spanish urban planner Arturo Soria y Mata proposed the Ciudad Lineal, or Linear City, which would start with a railway or roadway and have all buildings and other parts of the city constructed along this line. The district of Ciudad Lineal in Madrid was built with this idea in mind, and its main thoroughfare is named after Soria y Mata — but the neighborhood does not stand alone from the rest of Madrid. \"It just kind of became sprawl,\" Talen told Live Science. Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, was originally planned as the ideal city, shaped like an airplane with government buildings lining the fuselage. But Brasilia has been criticized as not particularly livable, with few mixed-use neighborhoods and little housing within the city center for lower-income families. This meant long commutes for many who worked in the city. \"Usually, we\\'re far better off making thoughtful incremental improvements to existing cities than trying to design entirely new cities from scratch,\" Wheeler told Live Science. Often, when communities are planned from scratch, \"we wind up with kind of a sterile, master-planned community that doesn\\'t have the richness of something that evolves over time.\" — 5 resources nations need to survive in a warming world — 10 reasons New York is \\'greener\\' than California — 5 reasons to love sustainable architecture A far more sustainable strategy, Talen said, is to fix existing cities. \"Should all these resources be spent on building anew in the middle of a desert?\" Talen said. \"How does that make sense when you have plenty of urban problems all around you that need repairing?\" What\\'s more, many pie-in-the-sky built-from-scratch cities cater not to locals, but to tourists or second-home owners. The Sustainable City in Dubai, for example, is touted as the first net-zero-energy city but caters heavily to foreigners buying second homes. Similarly, The Line\\'s press materials boast that Neom is within a 4-hour plane trip for 40% of the world\\'s population. \"Whether that is a sustainable lifestyle is pretty debatable,\" Wheeler said.

       "  'Full Article': 'A lonely meteorite that landed in the Sahara Desert in 2020 is older than Earth. The primeval space rock is about 4.6 billion years old, and is the oldest known example of magma from space. Its age and mineral content hint that the rock originated in our early solar system from the crust of a protoplanet — a large, rocky body in the process of developing into a planet, according to a new study. The meteorite, called Erg Chech 002 (EC 002), is likely a rare surviving chunk of a lost baby planet that was destroyed or absorbed by bigger rocky planets during our solar system\\'s formation. Related: Space-y tales: The 5 strangest meteorites Pieces of EC 002 were found in Adrar, Algeria, in May 2020, and the fragments were \"relatively coarse grained, tan and beige,\" sporadically studded with crystals that were \"larger green, yellow-green and less commonly yellow-brown,\" according to a description by the\\xa0Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI). EC 002 is an achondrite, a type of meteorite that comes from a parent body with a distinct crust and core, and lacks round mineral grains called chondrules, according to the Center for Meteorite Studies at Arizona State University. Approximately 3,100 known meteorites originated in crust and mantle layers of rocky asteroids, but they reveal little about protoplanet diversity when our solar system was young. About 95% come from just two parent bodies, and around 75% of those originated from one source — possibly the asteroid 4 Vesta, one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt, the researchers reported.  Among the thousands of rocky meteorites, EC 002 stood out. Radioactive versions, or isotopes, of aluminum and magnesium indicated that the meteorite\\'s parent was an ancient body dating to 4.566 billion years ago, and EC 002\\'s chemical composition revealed that it emerged from a partly-melted magma reservoir in the parent body\\'s crust. Most rocky meteorites come from sources with basaltic crusts — rapidly cooled lava that is rich in iron and magnesium — but EC 002\\'s composition showed that its parent\\'s crust was made of andesite, which is rich in silica. \"This meteorite is the oldest magmatic rock analyzed to date and sheds light on the formation of the primordial crusts that covered the oldest protoplanets,\" the study authors reported. While EC 002 is highly unusual, other studies have found that such silica-infused andesite crusts were likely common during our solar system\\'s protoplanet-forming stage, \"contrary to what the meteorite record suggests,\" the researchers wrote. – The 7 strangest asteroids: Weird space rocks in our solar system – Photo gallery: Images of Martian meteorites – Space rocks! Photos of meteorites for sale \"It is reasonable to assume that many similar chondritic bodies accreted at the same time and were capped by the same type of primordial crust,\" the study authors said. Yet, when the scientists peered at distant cosmic objects\\' spectral \"fingerprints\" — wavelength patterns in the light they emit or reflect — and compared them to EC 002, they found no matches. Even after comparison with 10,000 objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database, EC 002 was \"clearly distinguishable from all asteroid groups,\" the scientists reported. \"No object with spectral characteristics similar to EC 002 has been identified to date.\" Where are all the protoplanets with andesite crusts today? During our solar system\\'s volatile period of planetary birth, most of these protoplanets likely didn\\'t make it past infancy, according to the study. Either they were smashed to bits in collisions with other rocky bodies, or they were absorbed by bigger and more successful rocky planets, such as Earth, Mars, Venus and Mercury, leaving few traces behind to spawn meteorites such as EC 002. \"Remains of primordial andesitic crust are therefore not only rare in the meteorite record, but they are also rare today in the asteroid belt,\" the scientists wrote.

       "  'Full Article': 'Octopuses can \"see\" light with their arms, even when their eyes are in the dark, researchers have found. When the arms of the octopus detect light, the eight-armed creature pulls them close to their body. Because octopuses generally have a poor sense of where their body is in space, this complex instinctive behavior might help protect their arms from the pincers of predators nearby that they might otherwise not sense. Scientists have long known that octopus arms react to light. Their skin is covered in pigment-filled organs called chromatophores that reflexively change color when exposed to light. These chromatophores are responsible for the octopus\\'s color-changing camouflage superpowers. In fact, it was while studying these light-induced chromatophore responses that Tal Shomrat and Nir Nesher of the Ruppin Academic Center in Israel noticed something odd. Related: 8 crazy facts about octopuses At the time, an undergraduate student in their lab was shining bright lights on octopus arms to elicit a chromatophore response. But the octopus was not cooperating. \"We were using a very strong flashlight and when we illuminated the tip of the arm, it would always pull away. It was very surprising,\" Shomrat told LiveScience. \"We shifted our experiment to explore this behavior after we found out that nobody had described it before.\" Their new experiment involved placing an octopus in a tank covered in an opaque black tarp. The octopus, kept in the dark, was trained to reach an arm through a small hole in the top of the tank to find pieces of fish. While the octopus was blindly feeling around for a piece of food, the researchers would shine a bright light on the octopus\\'s arm at a random time; about 84% of the time when they shone the light, the octopus would rapidly pull its arm away, \\xa0suggesting that the octopus is able to sense and react to light with its arms, even when they can\\'t see the light with their eyes. \"We often feel the heat from intense light, but for the octopus, this isn\\'t the case,\" Neshir said. \"In our experiments, we checked for changes in temperature and there weren\\'t any. The effect is from pure light.\" Having established that octopus arms can sense and react to light, their next step was to explore what controls this reaction. Is it a simple reflex controlled completely by neurons — or special nerve cells —in the arm, or is it controlled by the brain? To answer this question, they performed a few additional experiments. First, they illuminated different parts of the octopus\\'s arm to determine the region most sensitive to light. They found that the tip of the arm was the most sensitive to it. Next, they illuminated the arms of several anesthetized octopuses. If light avoidance were entirely based on a local reflex, it might occur in an unconscious octopus. However, while the chromatophores in the sleeping octopus reflexively reacted to the light, the arms didn\\'t pull away. When the scientists cut the muscles at the base of the arms, that also eliminated the arm retraction. Put together, the studies suggest that the arm is sensing the light, sending a message to the brain through nerves in the muscle, and the brain is telling the octopus to move the arm. One of Shomrat and Neshir\\'s experiments confirmed this, too. When they would shine the light on a piece of fish, the octopus would initially avoid the food before seemingly deciding to override its instincts and grab the fish anyway. \"The fact that this behavior is not a reflex, but instead controlled by higher-level cognition in the brain is fascinating,\" said Eduardo Sampaio, an octopus behavior researcher at the University of Lisbon in Portugal, who was not involved in the study. —Photos: Deep-sea expedition discovers metropolis of octopuses —In photos: Amazing \\'octomom\\' protects eggs for 4.5 years —Photos: Ghostly dumbo octopus dances in the deep sea Shomrat and Neshir think this reaction may have evolved as a way for the octopus to protect its arms from predators. They say that predators that hunt by sight might mistake a misplaced octopus arm for a worm or small fish. Being able to feel light with the tip of the arm might help the octopus keep its arms out of harm\\'s way. \"The behavior is so robust and obvious, it is interesting that nobody had described it before,\" Shomrat said. \"Now, our next steps are to investigate the evolution and purpose of the behavior.\" Shomrat, Nesher and Itamar Katz, also of the Ruppin Academic Center, published their findings online Feb. 3 in the Journal of Experimental Biology.

Ancient Egyptians are known for mummifying countless animals to honor the gods, but this cemetery is different, said study lead researcher Marta Osypińska, a zooarchaeologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw. Unlike some mummified animals that were interred at other sites, sometimes through starvation or a snapped neck, none of the creatures in this cemetery — located on the outskirts of the Red Sea port of Berenice — showed signs that they had died at the hands of people. Instead, \"we have old, sick and deformed animals that had to be fed and looked after by someone,\" Osypińska told Live Science in an email. \"We have animals (almost all) that are very carefully buried.

In 2011, archaeologists began finding the remains of small animals in one area, so they looped in Osypińska because of her speciality in zooarchaeology. \"It turned out to be dozens of cat skeletons,\" she said. In fact, of the 585 animals they excavated, 536 were cats, 32 dogs, 15 monkeys, one fox and one falcon. None of the animals were mummified, but some were placed in makeshift coffins.

Just like some pets today, these animals may have worked for their owners, Osypińska said. For instance, cats may have been mousers and the dogs could have helped guard and hunt. But a few of the animals were deformed, meaning they likely couldn\\'t run. \"Someone fed and kept such a \\'useless\\' cat,\" Osypińska said. Her team also found dogs, some nearly toothless, that made it to old age, and three \"toy dogs,\" smaller than cats, that were likely too small to work. —Photos: Canine catacomb was tribute to ancient death god —In photos: ancient Egyptian tombs decorated with creatures —Purrfect photos: Cat mummies and wooden cat statues discovered at ancient Egyptian burial complex Other clues indicated these animals were pets, including the fact that many of the cats wore iron-made collars or beaded necklaces, \"sometimes very precious and exclusive,\" Osypińska said. An ostracon, a piece of ceramic with text — like an \"antique text message\" — found at the site had a note from when some pet cats were still alive, telling an owner not to worry about the cats, because someone else was taking care of them, she added. Many scholars argue that the ancient world had no concept of \"pets,\" but \"our discovery shows that we humans have a deep need for the companionship of animals,\" Osypińska said. About 2,000 years ago, \"the port of Berenice was at the end of the world. It was an empty, hostile piece of the world,\" she said. \"Merchants came here to bring exclusive goods to the empire. What they took on such a long and difficult journey: a beloved dog, or they [had] a monkey brought from India, or kept cats.\" The study was published online Jan. 25 in the journal World Archaeology.

       "  'Title': 'This sea slug can chop off its head and grow an entire new body, twice',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Two species of sea slugs can pop off their heads and regrow their entire bodies from the noggin down, scientists in Japan recently discovered. This incredible feat of regeneration can be achieved in just a couple of weeks and is absolutely mind-blowing. Most cases of animal regeneration — replacing damaged or lost body parts with an identical replacement — occur when arms, legs or tails are lost to predators and must be regrown. But these sea slugs, which belong to a group called sacoglossans, can take it to the next level by regrowing an entirely new body from just their heads, which they seem to be able to detach from their original bodies on purpose. If that wasn\\'t strange enough, the slugs\\' heads can survive autonomously for weeks thanks in part to their unusual ability to photosynthesize like plants, which they hijack from the algae they eat. And if that\\'s still not enough in the bizarro realm, the original decapitated body can also go on living for days or even months without their heads. Related: 11 body parts grown in the lab \"We believe that this is the most extreme form of autonomy and regeneration in nature,\" lead author Sayaka Mitoh, a doctoral student at Nara Women\\'s University in Japan, told Live Science. Further investigations revealed that another species of sacoglossan sea slug (Elysia atroviridis) also undergoes this type of regeneration and that certain individuals can pull off the trick more than once. Mitoh first stumbled across this bizarre behavior by accident when she spotted the detached head of a sacoglossan sea slug (Elysia cf. marginata) circling its detached body in a tank at the Yusa Lab at Nara Women\\'s University in 2018. \"One day, I found an individual of Elysia cf. marginata with its head and its body separated,\" Mitoh said. \"I thought the poor slug would die soon.\" But instead of dying, the wound at the back of the slug\\'s head quickly healed and was replaced by the beginnings of an entirely new body. \"After a few days, the head started regenerating the body and I could see [the] beating of the heart. It was unbelievable,\" Mitoh told Live Science. \"I was really happy and relieved when I found it could regenerate the body.\" After around three weeks, the slug had finished its body-swapping stunt and replaced the 80% of its body it had originally lost, including all the vital organs it had been able to live without for so long, according to Mitoh. The slug\\'s brand-new body was a perfect replica of the original, which researchers found was also doing reasonably well on it\\'s own. \"The [original] body continues to move and live for days to months,\" Mitoh said. \"You can see the heart beating\" inside them, she added. However, the decapitated bodies did not appear to be capable of growing new heads themselves.  Exactly how the slugs regenerate their bodies from the head down is still unknown, but the researchers suspect stem cells — special undifferentiated cells that have the potential to be turned into any type of cell — play an important role. \"We think that some multipotent [stem] cells may be involved in the regeneration process,\" Mitoh said. In the future, she and her team hope to \"further explore the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon at the tissue and cellular levels,\" she added. The scientists are also not sure how the sea slugs sever their heads from their bodies in the first place or why they would want to, especially when there is no visible reason to discard their old bodies and start again. A leading theory is that the slugs do it to remove internal parasites that have infested their old bodies. However, it may also just be a way to survive attacks from predators by sacrificing their bodies and escaping as autonomous heads and could have been triggered by something else in the lab, Mitoh said. However, the researchers found that only the younger slugs are capable of autonomy and regeneration. When older slugs had their heads removed, the heads survived for up to 10 days but they never started eating and did not start to regenerate before dying. \"We think that very old ones gain little merit from autotomy, as they probably cannot reproduce,\" Mitoh said. Although one individual in the study underwent autonomy and regeneration twice, the researchers suspect that this is probably the limit and that after a certain stage in their lives the slugs probably lose the ability altogether. The regeneration process requires a lot of energy, which is challenging for an autonomous head to acquire, Mitoh said. However, the sacoglossans have a secret weapon: These particular slugs are capable of kleptoplasty, or the ability to steal chloroplasts — the parts of a cell that allow plants to convert sunlight into energy via photosynthesis — from the algae they eat and use them in their own tissues. This allows the slugs to photosynthesize, which gives them enough energy to start the regeneration process. — Sea science: 7 bizarre facts about the ocean — Dangers in the deep: 10 scariest sea creatures — In photos: Sea life thrives at otherworldly hydrothermal vent system \"They rely on photosynthesis just after autotomy and when food is scarce,\" Mitoh said. \"But the stolen chloroplasts last only for several days for these sea slug species, and so they probably need to eat to complete regeneration.\" Mitoh and her colleagues will look for other species of sacoglossan that can regenerate in this way. \"Sacoglossan sea slugs are well known for their ability for kleptoplasty, and we now learned that they have another great ability,\" Mitoh said. \"We are very interested in these small animals.\" The study was published online Mar. 8 in the journal Current Biology.

       "  'Title': 'Earth has a hidden layer, and no one knows exactly what it is',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Earth might have more layers than scientists thought. New research finds that there may be a hidden layer inside the Earth\\'s solid inner core — an inner-inner core, if you will. The precise nature of this layer is mysterious, but it could have something to do with changes in the structure of iron under extreme temperatures and pressure. The study reveals that there is more complexity to the inner core than previously appreciated, said Jo Stephenson, a doctoral student in seismology at Australian National University in Canberra, who led the research. \"It\\'s not just a solid ball of iron,\" Stephenson told Live Science. Related: Earth\\'s 8 biggest mysteries Earth\\'s core comes in two parts. The liquid outer core starts about 1,800 miles (2,897 kilometers) from the surface of Earth and is made of liquid metals at temperatures of 4,000 to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,204 to 4,982 degrees Celsius). At about 3,200 miles (5,150 km) below Earth\\'s surface, the core transitions to solid iron (and a bit of nickel). The first inklings that there might be something interesting lurking at the center of the inner core came as far back as the 1980s. Because there\\'s no way to get to the inner core, where temperatures approach those at the surface of the sun, scientists use earthquake waves to make images of the core. Waves from an earthquake on one side of the planet that are detected on the other side of the planet carry subtle changes that scientists can use to recreate an image of what they\\'ve passed through. Strangely, when waves pass through the core from north to south, they travel faster than waves passing through the core parallel to the Earth\\'s equator. No one knows why this is, Stephenson said, but it\\'s a consistent finding. The technical term for this oddity is anisotropy. But at the very center of the inner core, something seems to be different, scientists noticed in the early 2000s. At this depth, the anisotropy seemed not to match that of the rest of the inner core. \"For the last two decades it has been very, very unclear what this signal in the center of the Earth in the data is and why we see it,\" Stephenson said. Stephenson and her colleagues brought together a dataset of about 100,000 earthquake waves that passed through this level of the core and applied an algorithm that searches for the best physical explanation of what\\'s going on to explain the data. What they found was that in the inner-inner core, starting about 400 miles (650 km) from the center of Earth, the anisotropy in the slow direction isn\\'t quite parallel with the equator anymore, but 54 degrees off. \"This isn\\'t just noise in the data, this is really something that\\'s there,\" Stephenson said. But it\\'s not easy to say what that something is. The researchers are now working with mineral physicists and geodynamicists to try to come up with models of the inner-inner core that would explain this change. As the planet cools, the inner core is cooling and expanding, Stephenson said, so the inner-inner core structure could have something to with the way iron crystallizes as it cools, or it could be due to changes in the way the metal behaves at great temperatures and pressures. — 10 ways Earth revealed its weirdness — Earth from above: 101 stunning images from orbit — 5 ways the world will change radically this century Imaging the core is complex, in part because the deep earthquakes that scientists use for imaging don\\'t occur evenly across the globe. This spotty dataset leads to blind spots. Seismologists and geophysicists are now working on ways to tease out subtle types of earthquake waves called exotic phases that have passed through the inner core. These phases are usually too subtle to make out from a single earthquake, but they can be detected in large datasets of thousands of earthquakes. The core is important to understand, Stephenson said, because its swirling interactions create Earth\\'s magnetic field. The magnetic field, in turn, shields the planet from charged particles streaming from the sun. This protection enabled the evolution of life. \"It\\'s really, really important,\" Stephenson said.

       "  'Title': \"This 'Ninja Giant' is the oldest titanosaur on record\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'A new long-neck dinosaur discovered in Argentina might be the oldest titanosaur ever discovered. The dinosaur, dubbed Ninjatitan zapati, lived 140 million years ago, which is 20 million years before the appearance of the next known titanosaur species. The discovery suggests that this group of hefty sauropods first emerged on the supercontinent Gondwana, which was made up of what is now South America, Antarctica, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the Indian subcontinent and Saudi Arabia. N. zapati was discovered in 2014 by Jonatan Aroca, a technician of El Chocón Museum in Neuquén, Argentina. Aroca was prospecting at a dig site in southwest Neuquén, located in Patagonia. This site was known for sauropod discoveries, and Aroca was searching for new finds outside of previous excavations when he discovered a titanosaur scapula. Related: Photos: 100-million-year-old Tanzania titanosaur had heart-shaped tail bones Further excavations turned up some vertebrae, a femur and a fibula (a lower-leg bone). The remains established that the fossils came from a brand-new titanosaur.      Some titanosaurs could grow up to 131 feet (40 meters) in length, but N. zapati was a relative pipsqueak at 66 feet (20 m) long. It still had the column-like legs and long neck and tail of a typical titanosaur, study author Pablo Ariel Gallina, a paleontologist at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council of Argentina, told Live Science. The researchers named the dinosaur after vertebrate paleontologist Sebastián \"Ninja\" Apesteguía, who led the first excavations from 2010 to 2014 of the Bajada Colorado Formation where the dinosaur was discovered. Zapati was chosen to honor Rogelio \"Mupi\" Zapata, a technician of the Museo Municipal Ernesto Bachman, who also made important discoveries at the site. The discovery puts titanosaurs in the early Cretaceous period in Gondwana, showing that they were already established by this time, Gallina said. Older long-neck dinosaurs have been discovered before, including members of the broader group that titanosaurs are part of, titanosauriforms, which seems to have arisen in the late Jurassic and also includes the brachiosaurids. But N. zapati is the oldest known member of the titanosaur branch of that family tree. — Photos: One of the world\\'s biggest dinosaurs — Photos: Meet Wade, the Long-Necked Dinosaur from Down Under — Photos: The most romantic titanosaur The find confirms what paleontologists had suspected about the group based on their worldwide distribution: that they arose early in Gondwana and then spread. One 2016 study suggested that titanosaurs originated in what is now South America, rapidly spread around Gondwana and later reached Europe via North Africa. By the middle to late Cretaceous, titanosaurs reached North America from South America and Asia via Europe. The new discovery bolsters that hypothesis, Gallina said. \"The Bajada Colorada dinosaur fauna represents one of the most diverse and unique associations not previously documented from the lowermost Cretaceous deposits worldwide, a moment in dinosaur evolution little explored,\" he wrote in an email to Live Science. Neuquén province has turned up many intriguing titanosaurs, including one yet-unnamed specimen discovered in January that might be the heaviest titanosaur on record. Paleontologists aren\\'t done excavating the new specimen, but its competition, Patagotitan mayorum, probably weighed 69 tons (62 metric tons), meaning it was more than 10 times heavier than an African elephant.

       "  'Full Article': 'A hippopotamus-size predator that lived 265 million years ago was unexpectedly speedy for such a bulky beast. Scientists previously viewed the dinosaur-like reptile Anteosaurus as slow and plodding because of its massive, heavy head and bones. However, a new analysis of the animal\\'s skull proved otherwise, revealing adaptations that would have made Anteosaurus a fast-moving juggernaut. With this deadly combination of speed and power — along with a mouthful of bone-crushing teeth — Anteosaurus would have been one of the most fearsome apex predators on the African continent during the middle part of the Permian period (299 million to 251 million years ago), according to a new study. Related: Wipe out: History\\'s most mysterious extinctions Anteosaurus belonged to a reptile family that predated dinosaurs, known as dinocephalians, and they all died out about 30 million years before the first dinosaurs appeared. Dinocephalians were also part of a larger group of animals called therapsids, which includes the ancestors of mammals. \"Dinocephalians were among the first herbivorous and carnivorous species that dominated terrestrial ecosystems,\" said lead study author Julien Benoit, a senior researcher at the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits University) in Johannesburg, South Africa. What\\'s more, dinocephalians were some of the earliest amniotes — animals that hatch from eggs laid on land or retained inside the mother\\'s body — to evolve very large body size, according to the study. Many dinocephalians also had sturdy skulls with reinforced horns, buffers and bumps, suggesting that the animals may have used their heavy heads as battering rams.  Because Anteosaurus\\' skeleton was so massive, researchers previously hypothesized that it was a slow-moving animal that likely ambushed its prey, Benoit told Live Science in an email. \"Some authors even suggested that it might have been amphibious because it was just too heavy to support its weight on land — similar to what used to be imagined about dinosaurs,\" Benoit said. \"Our study suggests it is quite the opposite.\" Anteosaurus had a weighty, knobby skull with a prominent crest on the snout, and Benoit and his co-authors questioned if Anteosaurus was a head-butter, like some of its dinocephalian relatives. To find out, they scanned the skull of a juvenile Anteosaurus magnificus from the Karoo desert region in South Africa. They used X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) to create high-resolution images that revealed the interior of the skull in exceptional detail and then used those images to reconstruct the skull and its long-gone internal structures as digital 3D models. Their scans provided the first-ever glimpse of an Anteosaurus\\' inner ear — and it was definitely not the inner ear of a head-butting animal, Benoit said. \"When the skull is adapted to head butting, the inner ear is tilted backward because of a reorientation of the braincase to absorb head-to-head combat stress,\" Benoit said. But A. magnificus lacked that adaptation, so it probably didn\\'t use its head for ramming. \"Instead, it would have used its massive canines for fighting,\" Benoit said.  – 5 fossil hotspots: National parks to visit – Gallery: Evolution\\'s most extreme mammals – Photos: Ancient crocodile relatives roamed the Amazon The scientists also found surprising clues about Anteosaurus\\' abilities by reconstructing and measuring the dimensions of its inner ear canal, which is a feature associated with balance, and lobes in its cerebellum called the flocculi, which assist with agility and help predators lock their eyes on their prey. The shapes of these structures resembled those found in predators such as cats and velociraptors, hinting that Anteosaurus had a nervous system adapted to catching fast-moving prey, Benoit said. \"When you contemplate the bones of this animal, they look so heavy and massive that this really came up as a surprise,\" he said. \"I guess this comes in part from the misconception that fossilized bones are so heavy, it is hard to imagine that they were once light and pulled by muscles powerful enough to make them move.\" Superior swiftness and agility would have enabled Anteosaurus to prey on another group of big-skulled and formidable Permian reptiles known as therocephalians, or \"beast-heads,\" placing it at the top of the food chain, according to the study. And this is just the beginning of what researchers are yet to discover about the strange reptiles that came before the dinosaurs, Benoit said. \"Soon we will be capable of comparing the brain and inner ear of Anteosaurus to many of its close relatives,\" he said. \"This will shed new light on the interactions between animals of an entirely extinct ecosystem.\" The findings were published online Feb. 18 in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica.

The elaborate breastplate and helmet were stolen from the renowned Paris museum on May 31, 1983, and then vanished for the next 38 years. Forged in Milan during the Italian Renaissance between 1560 and 1580, the metal armor was inlaid with gold and silver and is estimated to be worth about $603,000 (500,000 euros), the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported on March 3. In January, a military antiquities expert spotted the armor after he was hired by an auctioneer for an estate auction appraisal in Bordeaux, France. He was suspicious about the armor\\'s origins, so he notified officials with the French Central Office for the Fight against Trafficking in Cultural Goods (OCBC), a special police unit for tracking stolen property of historical and cultural importance.

       "  'Title': 'Can animals give birth to identical twins, triplets or even quadruplets?',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'One new baby is a handful — but what about two or more? One in 30 parents have their hands full with twins, and nearly one in 10,000 juggle triplets or more, according to U.S. data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But how unusual is humans\\' ability to bear multiple young at once, and how often do other mammals have twins, triplets and quadruplets? In many animals, multiple babies are the norm rather than the exception. For example, the average dog gives birth to five puppies in a litter, according to a 2011 study published in the journal Theriogenology. So, what\\'s the difference between a litter and twins? \"It really just comes down to number,\" said Charles Long, a reproductive physiologist at Texas A&M University. Whereas a set of twins is by definition two babies, litter-bearing animals almost always have more. Related: Why pregnancy really lasts 9 months A female animal has a litter when she releases multiple eggs. When fertilized, these eggs produce multiple embryos. (Identical twins are the exception — but we\\'ll get to that later.) When a woman releases two eggs, we call the resulting offspring fraternal or non-identical twins. (Three eggs results in fraternal triplets, four in fraternal quadruplets. You get the picture.) Whether they\\'re littermates or fraternal twins, these siblings share about half of their DNA — the same as any other sibling pair. Litter-bearing animals tend to give birth to more than three babies, on average, Long said. But the difference between litters and twins ends there. Technically, there\\'s no difference between a litter of five and a set of fraternal quintuplets — aside from the fact that human quintuplets are exceptionally rare. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported only 49 quintuplet and higher order births out of 3,855,500 total births. On the other hand, some animals rarely give birth to litters, and instead nearly always bear two young with each pregnancy. In these animals, two babies born at the same time are called twins, not littermates. However, these are usually fraternal, not identical twins. Sheep, goats, and deer all regularly give birth to fraternal twins, Long said. But what about identical twins? These genetically identical siblings form when a single fertilized egg splits in two. They\\'re rare in humans: about three to four in 1,000 human births result in identical twins, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. And as far as scientists can tell, they’re less common in other animals. Veterinarians have identified identical puppies only once, in 2016. In that rare instance, a veterinarian performing a C-section on an Irish wolfhound happened to notice that two of the puppies shared a placenta. A genetic test confirmed that the two puppies shared all of their DNA. But scientists usually aren’t on the lookout for identical twins in other animals, which may be why they appear so uncommon. —Why are more boys born than girls? —Why are human babies so helpless? —What\\'s behind the myth that storks deliver babies? In one animal, identical siblings are the rule, not a rarity. Armadillos always give birth to identical quadruplets. In other words, female armadillos ovulate one egg that subsequently splits into four once fertilized. Scientists aren\\'t sure why this happens, or why it\\'s unique to armadillos, Long said. One possible explanation: having identical quadruplets prevents inbreeding. Armadillo siblings can\\'t possibly mate with one another, so they\\'re forced to venture outside of their underground burrows to find mates. And other animals may give birth to identical twins at higher rates than humans realize. \"If a sheep has twin males or twin females, we don\\'t go and test them to see if they\\'re identical,\" Long said. The uncanny resemblance shared by identical twins isn\\'t a helpful clue, he added. \"You know, sheep look alike.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

Garriott, who is the incoming president of The Explorers Club, made the dive on board the \"Limiting Factor,\" the first commercially certified, full-ocean-depth deep submergence vehicle that was developed and funded by undersea explorer Victor Vescovo. It was aboard the same submersible with Vescovo as pilot that former NASA astronaut Kathy Sullivan became the first space traveler and first woman to dive to Challenger Deep — in August 2020. Like Sullivan, Garriott made the trip as part of a series of dives aimed at surveying the Mariana Trench and collecting scientific samples. Garriott, together with his friend Michael Dubno (who was mid-dive when Garriott called from the surface support ship, the \"Pressure Drop\"), also brought along their own set of engineering and artistic experiments for the journey. collectSPACE.com spoke with Garriott about his record-setting dive and the similarities it shared with his other adventures around, and off, the world. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. collectSPACE (cS): Though certainly the deepest, this was not your first dive. How did the four-hour descent to Challenger Deep compare to some of your other dives, such as to the Titanic and to hydrothermal vents aboard the Russian-built Mir submersibles? Richard Garriott: What\\'s interesting about Limiting Factor is that it\\'s going to more than twice the depth than I\\'d ever been previously and, as it turns out, that is mightily more difficult. To find equipment that can operate at half that depth is already virtually non-existent. So to find or create equipment that can operate at double that depth is even harder. They have had to overcome some amazing engineering problems, starting with just how to keep the passengers alive. The 9-centimeter-thick (3.5-inch) titanium hull is the smallest vehicle I\\'ve ever been in, although it felt roomier than a Soyuz [Russian spacecraft] because there is less people and material on the inside. So you actually feel very comfortable, but the interior diameter only starts at about 1.46 meters (4.79 feet) and shrinks to about 1.4 meters (4.59 feet) as the pressure builds on the outside.  The temperature also goes from quite warm on the surface here in the tropics [near Guam] to just right about freezing as you get down into the depths. It gets colder and colder. The light disappears almost immediately. Most other submarines in the world operate within a few hundred meters of the surface where there is generally still a little bit of light still available. This one is descending so fast and so far that it becomes truly pitch black outside the viewport mere moments after you depart and so you\\'re falling through the inky blackness for most of the four-hour descent. cS: During the descent, do you just sit there for four hours? Is there something to do? Do you take a nap? Garriott: I had taken with me a lot of things that I wanted to do on the interior [of the submsersible] associated with the outreach that I was doing with the schools across the U.S. and even more in the UK. Whether it was photography as part of a project that students were working on in concert with the company Canon or sharing and filming some of the artwork that school kids had created, or reading some poetry the kids had had written specifically for this challenge, that kept me busy for the downward journey and the upward journey. In fact, let me just mention something about the poetry, just because I think it was the one [activity] for me that was the most surprising. It\\'s really common to decorate [and dive down with] styrofoam cups to show how they get compressed [by the pressure] in the depths because it is a fun little keepsake, but it was a gentleman from the National Organization for Teaching English that came up with a challenge for students that basically said to stay alive and do work at this depths in the ocean, the developers of the submarine and the scientists on board have to take only the minimum number of things with them on the interior, things absolutely needed for life support and for experiments. The challenge to the kids was to write a poem called a cinquain, a five line poem of 22 total syllables, where the you\\'re only allowed two, four, six, eight and two syllables per line. So when you\\'re going to write a poem about how to dive down to the deepest point of the ocean, you have to choose not only every word, but frankly, every syllable very carefully. It turned out that was super popular for people to get involved in. Not only did kids across all of the UK schools submit really clever poems, but as soon as people on Twitter started hearing about it, I started hearing back from students across almost every continent on Earth. And I started hearing from relatives I didn\\'t even know I had from various parts of the country. All of them wanted a chance to participate.  Even my own kids and family got involved in writing these. And I wrote a few myself and even Victor Vescovo, the submarine developer and pilot, who was with me, he was enjoying these so much, he wrote one on the spot. He wrote one down in the Challenger Deep at the bottom and recited it for the kids from there at the bottom, too. That kept us busy for what otherwise could have been long spans of time on the descent and ascent. Reading poetry turned out to be just big fun and much more interesting than I expected. So there was very little time to rest or be bored. Traditionally everyone takes a movie for the way up. My selection was \"Das Boot,\" the German submarine warfare movie, but we only watched an hour of it because we were still so busy doing other activities. cS: What did you see and do when reached the deep, the bottom of the ocean? Garriott: Our dive plan was to drop down first right into the deepest part of the eastern pool, which is the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, just to check off the box that we had reached the deepest point and to leave a geocache, which we did. We left behind a 6-inch-square [15 cm] titanium plate connected to a 6-foot [1.8 m] line of Kevlar with a syntactic foam float. On all sides of the float and all sides of the titanium is the geocache numerical identifier and a secret word. The reason for the secret word is so that the only people who will be allowed to claim that they\\'ve been the ones to find it are those who know the secret word, ensuring that they\\'ve actually visited. So we successfully deployed [the geocache] in the center of the deepest point on Earth and then we cruised for about an hour across the sea floor. The sea floor down there, right where you land, is what I\\'m describing as the \\'abyssal plain.\\' It\\'s a desert of sorts. The bottom condition is both flat and has a very silty, murky bottom where the detritus from life seven miles [11 km] above it in the water column — whether it\\'s scales or dirt or dust or the rotting corpses of fish above — sort of slowly all rains and settles down here at the bottom. While at some point down below us you would get into what you might traditionally call mud, the actual entire surface is covered with maybe a foot thick [0.3 m] of this talcum powder fluff that is more like what you might imagine, or you might\\'ve seen in a Build-A-Bear Workshop where they have the fluff they shove into stuffed toys. There\\'s not really even a surface that looks particularly hard. It is very, very, very, very delicate. But there\\'s actually quite a bit of life down there. We saw almost every few feet or at least every dozen feet, one of these almost translucent crustaceans of a few inches long that would scoot around all over the bottom to make a meager existence out of the tiny amount of organic matter that makes it down there for food.  Then, as we crossed this abyssal plain, we actually ran into our first bit of humanity, which was a 7-mile-long [11 km] cable that had been previously attached to a remotely-operated vehicle. It\\'s worth noting that last summer when Victor was down here, this was not there. And between that visit and our visits, a Chinese crew had been out here with both one free diving submersible and one remotely operated vehicle, the latter to photograph the submarine. It\\'s a fairly common practice for those who use these extremely long tethers to jettison it and the problem with that is it creates an incredibly difficult hazard for submarines because it\\'s 7 miles long and loops and curls all over the sea floor and you can\\'t see it until you\\'re really in it. We saw it first crossing our paths in one direction and we were shocked to see it, a little bit alarmed and concerned. Then we saw the same cable, or presumably the same cable again, crossing our path the other direction. cS: Before you dove, you said you had intentions to try to collect geological samples from where the Pacific plate is being subducted below the Philippine Sea plate (which is why the Mariana Trench exists). Were you successful? Garriott: We were unable to get a rock back. We were having both some electrical problems and, unrelated, we were having some trouble with the manipulator arm. It turned out to be a software glitch. And then there was the condition of the rocks. Even though we were in the rockfall, all the rocks that we could see were still covered in this very deep murky soup that I described. Only little corners of large rocks stuck out and we really needed to find one that was small enough for the manipulator arm to pick up. Because of the covering of fluff, we couldn\\'t see the small rocks, much less reach in to pick them up. If you came close to this murky bottom, you get browned out by the kicking up of that silt that might take hours to settle again. And so we were unable to get a rock. That is a task we will leave to the next explorers. cS: One of your personal projects was to try to use the pressure outside of the submersible to hydroform, or mint, tokens. How did that go? Garriott: Oh, yes! We made a double-sided die with 18 bolts or so around a ring to clamp on metal plates to try to hydroform. The side that we put copper on did perfectly. It actually is a marvelous little, three-inch [7.6 cm] impression that was made across the die. What\\'s interesting is that there were still some air pockets below that copper plate, which means that a millimeter or two of copper is technically enough to where if you were to drill a hole in the side of the submarine — which you do not do — but if you did and covered it with even just a thin copper plate, it would bow into that quarter-inch [0.6 cm] hole, but wouldn\\'t break, it wouldn\\'t pop. It\\'s actually fascinating that on the one hand, this depth and pressure is awesome to try to think about how to build equipment to survive within it. On the other hand, it\\'s similarly awesome just how a simple experiment like hydroforming can show that even a thin sheet of metal, if it\\'s supported in the right way, will not break and still resist that amazing pressure. The other side of the die we had made with brass and the brass stayed stiffened straight up until water managed to encroach on the sides and fill the other half of the die. So we\\'ve added a little special lubricant that they use on the hatches that helps seal from water. We\\'ll see if that works.  cS: So now that you\\'ve conquered the deep, how would you compare it to your past adventures? Does one top the others or how would you rank them? Garriott: Well, space will be hard to beat, so space still wins. But the one thing that all of the locations share is that when you go to someplace that\\'s this extreme, the laws of physics really do seem to change profoundly. In space, the obvious one is floating around 24/7. Not feeling gravity is obviously a fundamental change in the physics associated with your life. In Antarctica, it\\'s the complete lack of being able to tell distance because there\\'s no specular hazing, there\\'s nothing like roads or telephone poles to give you a sense of perspective. And so large rocks far away and small rocks close up look the same. It\\'s a fascinating place to be because of how sight and sound works and the same is now true for these incredible depths where you can measure the hull being crushed around you. I took a digital tape measure and the submarine shrunk by 6 millimeters [0.2 inches] as went down to the depths. The pressure was so great that even things like the acoustic phones, which were made for communicating underwater, barely work at those depths. Water is non-compressible but in fact it does compress at least a little. The density of the water becomes greater and greater at these enormous depths. Our descent rate at the beginning was a couple of meters per second, but by the time we got to the bottom, the water itself became so dense that we slowed down to under a half a meter per second, just because we were almost becoming neutrally buoyant at the bottom, despite the fact that we were getting smaller by being crushed.

       "  'Title': \"Mount Etna's fiery eruptions seen from space (satellite photos)\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': ' Mount Etna has been spewing lava across Sicily for weeks during a series of eruptions captured by a slew of Earth-orbiting satellites. Etna, the most active volcano in all of Europe, has been in a state of eruption since 2011. The latest series began on Feb. 16. The volcano erupted that day, again on Feb. 18 and then again between Feb. 20 and 23. During these eruptions, fountains of lava shot high into the night sky, reaching 0.4 miles (0.7 kilometers) high earlier in the month and getting 0.9 miles (1.5 km) over the volcano\\'s summit later in the month. These most recent eruptions \"were among the most violent in the Southeast Crater\\'s young history,\" Marco Neri, a volcanologist with Italy\\'s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, said in a NASA statement. Related: Asteroid impact, not volcanic activity, killed the dinosaurs Earth-observing satellites were keen to check out the smoke, ash and lava flung out by the volcano. On Feb. 18, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on the NASA-U.S. Geological Survey Landsat 8 satellite snapped a natural color view of the volcano, which was overlaid with infrared data to show the warm areas (or spots where lava had broken through).  Also on Feb. 18, the European Space Agency\\'s Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, which is made up of two satellites, observed the eruption. The European satellites captured a moment that, using infrared imaging, showed the lava in bright orange and red.  A few days later, as Etna was erupting again on Feb. 23, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\'s NOAA-20 satellite snapped an image with its\\xa0 VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) instrument that highlights the plumes coming from the volcano. Landsat 8 captured a nighttime image of activity at #MtEtna on Feb 25, 2021. This image uses the thermal and shortwave infrared bands (Bands 10, 7, 6) to show the heat signature of the lava. pic.twitter.com/ryTDbKw0nAMarch 1, 2021 Landsat 8 observed the volcano again on Feb. 25, this time at night. Using thermal and shortwave infrared bands, it was able to show the lava down below based on the heat coming off of it. While these recent eruptions were impressive, they caused minor disruptions rather than major damage to the surrounding area, according to the NASA statement. Ash coming from Etna temporarily closed the Catania Airport and was deposited across Sicily, for example, and local residents had to deal with falling ash and rocks.

       "  'Title': 'What animal has the largest ears?',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Which animal has the largest ears? You might think it\\'s the elephant, and you\\'d be right — sort of. As the largest living land animal, the African elephant does have the biggest ears of any living animal, according to Mary Ellen Holden, a zoologist and mammalogist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. But the creature with the largest ears relative to the size of its body is the long-eared jerboa (Euchoreutes naso), a nocturnal, insect-eating rodent that lives in the deserts of China and Mongolia. The long-eared jerboa (rhymes with Samoa) measures about 4 inches (10 centimeters) from head to rump (not counting its long tail). Its ears, measuring 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5 cm) long, are 40% to 50% the length of its body. \"It has the longest ears relative to its body size in the entire animal kingdom,\" Holden told Live Science. For comparison, the ears of the African elephant average nearly 4 feet (1.2 m) in length, according to Holden, but that\\'s only about 17% of their body length, which averages about 20 to 25 feet (6 to 7.5 m). Related: Why are ears shaped so strangely? In 2007, the long-eared jerboa, which has rarely been seen on camera, made the news with a video taken during a Zoological Society of London trip to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. The critter is \"a bit like the Mickey Mouse of the desert,\" expedition leader and conservation biologist Jonathan Baillie said, according to the video description.      Why such big ears? Large ears help the long-eared jerboa and other mammals living in hot, dry environments get rid of excess heat. \"African elephants, fennec foxes, long-eared jerboas — they are able to thermoregulate by having rapid heat loss through the very highly vascularized ears,\" Holden said. These animals\\' ears are large and thin, and they house many tiny blood vessels, she said. While circulating through the ears, the blood releases heat into the air, thereby helping the animal cool off. When the animal is hot, the blood vessels in its ears expand to release even more heat, Holden said. At night, or whenever it\\'s cold, the animals\\' blood vessels constrict to help keep them warm. \"I think most people agree [that large ears] are generally correlated with warmer environments,\" Holden said. \"And if you look at African and Asian elephants, African elephant ears are much larger than Asian elephant ears, because African elephants inhabit a hotter climate.\" Asian elephants\\' ears, measuring about 1.6 feet (0.5 m) long, make up only about 8% of their body length. —Why can some people wiggle their ears? —Why can\\'t elephants jump? —What is the toothiest animal on Earth? As far as heat dissipation strategies go, using ears to cool off is a good adaptation to desert life. It serves as an alternative to sweating, allowing desert creatures to conserve water in an environment where that resource is scarce, according to Holden. Large ears may also help the long-eared jerboa detect the low-frequency sounds coming from its insect prey and its predators, Holden said. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': 'A small porcelain bowl bought for $35 at a yard sale in Connecticut turned out to be a rare, 15th-century Chinese artifact estimated to be worth between $300,000 and $500,000. Last year, after purchasing the bowl, the buyer was intrigued enough by its appearance to ask experts at the Sotheby\\'s auction house to evaluate it, according to The Associated Press. Only then did he find out that his yard-sale buy was an \"exceptional and rare\" bowl, with only six others of its kind known to exist, most of them in museums around the globe. It will now be auctioned at Sotheby\\'s Important Chinese Art auction in New York on March 17. The bowl, which is about 6.25 inches (16 centimeters) in diameter, is shaped like a lotus bud and painted with cobalt-blue floral patterns, according to the Sotheby\\'s listing. On the inside of the bowl, there\\'s a medallion design, surrounded by patterns of flowers and leaves; the exterior is painted with lotus, peony, chrysanthemum and pomegranate flowers surrounding miscellaneous objects, including horns and castanets. Related Content: Gallery: Ancient Chinese warriors protect secret tomb With its \"striking combination of superb material\" and \"slightly exotic design that characterizes imperial porcelain of this period,\" the bowl is a \"quintessential\" product from the reign of the Ming dynasty\\'s third emperor, known as the Yongle Emperor, who ruled from 1403 to 1424, according to Sotheby\\'s. — In photos: Treasures from 800-year-old tombs in China — Photos: Ancient beer recipe discovered in \\'cradle of Chinese civilization\\' — Photos: Ancient Chinese tomb full of bronze vessels The Yongle court, for which the bowl was made, brought a new style of porcelain to ancient China, \"a style immediately recognizable, never surpassed, and defining the craft still in the eighteenth century,\" according to the listing. During Yongle\\'s reign, the court controlled the design, production and distribution of the porcelain made in the imperial kilns. That meant that the porcelain wasn\\'t traded across typical channels to the Near East, Middle East and East Africa. And while larger pieces were exported to other countries, smaller ones, such as this bowl, were mostly sent to the court and are now mainly found in palace collections in Beijing and Taipei, Taiwan, according to Sotheby\\'s. Often, the Yongle court ordered duplicates of the porcelains to be destroyed or buried so that they wouldn\\'t be copied. And so, \"only very few companion bowls\" to this yard sale bowl exist, according to Sotheby\\'s: two in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, one in the National Museum of Iran, one in the British Museum, one in the Victoria & Albert Museum in London and one that was sold at Christie\\'s auction house in Hong Kong.

       "  'Title': \"Swarm of 20,000 earthquakes could make Iceland's volcanoes erupt\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'More than 20,000 earthquakes have shaken southern Iceland this week, rattling the capital city of Reykjavik and keeping geologists on their toes as all signs point to a pending volcanic eruption, the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) reported on Thursday (March 4). This week\\'s marathon of quakes continues a swarm of seismic activity that began on Feb. 24, when a 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Iceland\\'s Reykjanes Peninsula — about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the capital city. Earthquakes in the 5.0- to 5.9-magnitude range are considered moderate, and can result in slight damage to nearby buildings, according to Michigan Technological University. Fortunately, the quake\\'s epicenter was far enough from the island\\'s populated areas that no damage or injuries were reported. The vast majority of the thousands of quakes that have followed the Feb. 24 event have been minor, with only two temblors registering above magnitude 5.0, according to the IMO. Still, residents of Reykjavik have felt the shaking day after day, with some \"waking up with an earthquake, others [going] to sleep with an earthquake,\" Thorvaldur Thordarson, a professor of volcanology at the University of Iceland, told The New York Times. While disconcerting, there is \"nothing to worry about,\" Thordarson added, as the quakes have all been minor and distant enough to leave Reykjavik unharmed. (Meanwhile, the IMO issued a warning of increased landslide risk on the Reykjanes Peninsula, but had no further guidance for city-dwellers.) In the past, seismic swarms like this one have been observed ahead of volcanic eruptions in southern Iceland, according to the IMO. Magma movement at the boundary where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet likely caused the tremors, the agency said, which could fuel the five active volcanoes on the Reykjanes Peninsula. If any of southern Iceland\\'s volcanoes do blow their tops in the coming weeks, the eruptions will be both expected and manageable. According to Thordarson, southern Iceland\\'s volcanoes experience \"pulses\" of activity every 800 years or so, and the last pulse occurred between the 11th and 13th centuries. Iceland is \"on time\" for another eruption cycle, he added. Like the earthquakes, these potential eruptions should also pose little threat to the inhabitants of Iceland. Such eruptions would look nothing like the explosive 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, which sent an ash column more than 5 miles (9 km) into the sky, forced hundreds of people to evacuate and halted European air traffic for six days, volcanologist Dave McGarvie wrote in The Conversation. — In photos: The great San Francisco earthquake — Photos: The devastating damage from Indonesia earthquake and Tsunami — Northridge earthquake: 20th anniversary in photos \"Eruptions in southwest Iceland are of a fluid rock type called basalt. This results in slow-moving streams of lava fed from gently exploding craters and cones,\" wrote McGarvie, of Lancaster University in Lancashire, England. \"In Iceland, these are warmly called \\'tourist eruptions\\' as they are relatively safe and predictable.\" Currently, tourists entering Iceland are subject to a five-day quarantine period due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so hopeful volcano watchers will have move fast, or settle for the webcam view.

       "  'Title': 'Why is China giving travelers anal tests for COVID-19?',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Travelers to some Chinese cities have been required to take anal swab tests for COVID-19, a measure that has sparked outcries from other countries, according to news reports. This week, officials in Japan complained that some Japanese citizens arriving in China had been subjected to the tests, which \"caused great psychological pain,\" according to the BBC. And in February, some U.S. diplomats said they were required to take the tests, which prompted a complaint from the U.S. State Department, Vice reported. \"The State Department never agreed to this kind of testing and protested directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when we learned that some staff were subject to it,\" a spokesperson for the State Department told Vice. (Chinese officials denied that U.S. diplomats had been asked to undergo anal testing, Vice reported.) It is unclear how many international travelers have been required to take the anal tests, but Beijing and Shanghai have reportedly required the tests for some arrivals, according to The New York Times. Some Chinese doctors say the tests are performed to catch silent carriers of the virus — those who may not show symptoms or who develop mild symptoms but recover quickly — because the novel coronavirus can be detected in feces for longer than in the nose and throat. \"Some asymptomatic patients or those with minor symptoms recover fast [from COVID-19], and it\\'s possible that throat tests won\\'t be effective for these people,\" Li Tongzeng, an infectious disease doctor in China, told CNN. \"Researchers have shown that for some infected people, the duration time of positive nucleic results lasted longer on their excrement and anal swab test [samples] than those on the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, adding anal swab tests can improve the positive detection rate of the infected,\" he said, referring to the so-called PCR diagnostic tests for the virus. —The sneaky way the coronavirus mutates to escape the immune system —14 coronavirus myths busted by science —11 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across species Some Chinese citizens have also been required to take anal COIVD-19 tests. In January, more than 1,000 students and teachers in a school district in Beijing received anal swab tests, as well as nasal swab tests, for COVID-19 after a 9-year-old student in the district tested positive, according to Vice. Other people staying at quarantine hotels have been asked to take the tests. One person told Vice that he was asked to take an anal test in September 2020 while at a quarantine hotel after he returned from Australia. He said the test was administered by nurses and that it \"felt like he was having diarrhea,\" Vice reported. The tests have been controversial among experts, even in China. Yang Zhanqiu, a deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the state-controlled Chinese newspaper the Global Times in January that nasal and throat tests were still more effective than anal tests, because the virus is known to spread through respiratory droplets rather than through feces. If the point of the tests is to keep an infected person from spreading the virus, the argument goes, then the nasal/throat tests would work best. \"There have been cases concerning the coronavirus testing positive in a patient\\'s excrement, but no evidence has suggested it had been transmitted through one\\'s digestive system,\" Yang said. Experts outside of China also question the practice, since those who test positive for COVID-19 on an anal test but not on a nasal or throat test would likely not be very contagious, according to The New York Times. \"The value of detecting people with the virus is to stop transmission,\" Benjamin Cowling, a public health professor at the University of Hong Kong, told the Times. \"If someone has got an infection but they\\'re not contagious to anyone else, we didn\\'t need to detect that person.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': \"World's rarest seals have a secret breeding cave in Cyprus\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'The world\\'s rarest seals have been caught on camera in secret breeding caves in northern Cyprus. The new breeding sites provide hope for a struggling species, but the caves are now in need of protection. Mediterranean monk seals (Monachus monachus) are the most endangered of all the pinniped species — a group that includes seals, sea lions, sea otters and walruses — with just 700 individuals left in the wild, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of endangered species. A large number of those seals live in and around Cyprus. Due to human pressures, such as bycatch and tourism, the monk seals have been forced to raise their pups inside cave systems, rather than their usual open beaches, on the island. A new study using camera traps, carried out by researchers from the University of Exeter in the U.K. and the Society for the Protection of Turtles (SPOT) in Cyprus, has revealed several previously unknown breeding caves in northern Cyprus, the first to be found along the north coast of the island. Related: Photos: Stunning shots of the natural world and wildlife \"The study has found regular breeding, identified important sites and shown some seals are using the site year after year,\" lead author Damla Beton, a marine biologist at SPOT, said in a video about the study. \"It is very important to make sure that these sites are protected.\" For centuries fishers across the Mediterranean have killed monk seals for a variety of reasons: the seals damage their fishing gear; they compete for the same fish prey; and the seal skin can be sold on the black market for its unsubstantiated health benefits. More recently, fishers have captured the seals for use in the aquarium trade as performers; meanwhile, the pinnipeds have lost habitat to the tourism industry, according to the Seal Conservation Society in the U.K.. Historically, monk seals would have used beaches as places to rest and raise their pups like every other species of seal. However, because of historic hunting and a lack of undistrubed beaches, they have been forced to start using alternative locations.  \"They need caves to breed in and raise their pups out of sight of humans,\" Beton said. Although the caves keep the monk seals and their pups safe, only a small number of caves monitored are suitable for pupping, according to the researchers. In 2007, a survey found 39 breeding caves on the south coast of Cyprus (although several have since been destroyed), according to the researchers. However, despite frequently being seen in the north of the island, there was no evidence the seals were breeding there. \"It has long been known that they use north Cyprus coasts, but in 2013 we observed a pup in Alagadi [in north Cyprus], which confirmed them breeding,\" Beton said in the video. \"In 2016, we started the first breeding surveys using camera traps placed in caves.\"  The research continued until 2019 and revealed that, out of the eight caves monitored, the seals were using three for breeding. At one of the caves, a single seal also managed to successfully raise pups three years in a row, suggesting that these caves are high-quality breeding sites and could play an important role in keeping population numbers up. The discovery of new monk seal breeding sites is welcome news to conservationists, but they say now it is important to protect these sites for the future. \"This area of coastline is being developed rapidly, especially for construction of hotels,\" Robin Snape, an environmental biologist at the University of Exeter, said in a statement. \"The main breeding site we identify in this study currently has no protected status, and we are working with local authorities to try to change this.\" — The 7 longest caves in the world — Ocean sounds: The 8 weirdest noises of the Antarctic — 8 of the world\\'s most endangered places However, losing their breeding sites is not the only challenge facing the monk seals. \"Another major threat to monk seals in this area is bycatch,\" Beton said in the statement. This means they get accidentally caught in a fisher\\'s nets, which often causes them to drown before they can be freed. \"We need to work with fishers to secure food sources for monk seals and prevent bycatch, especially around these caves,\" Beton said in the video.

       "  'Title': \"Black holes could be dark stars with 'Planck hearts'\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Black holes, those gravitational monsters so named because no light can escape their clutches, are by far the most mysterious objects in the universe. But a new theory proposes that black holes may not be black at all. According to a new study, these black holes may instead be dark stars home to exotic physics at their core. This mysterious new physics may cause these dark stars to emit a strange type of radiation; that radiation could in turn explain all the mysterious dark matter in the universe, which tugs on everything but emits no light. Related: The 11 biggest unanswered questions about dark matter Thanks to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which describes how matter warps space-time, we know that some massive stars can collapse in on themselves to such a degree that they just keep collapsing, shrinking down into an infinitely tiny point — a singularity. Once the singularity forms, it surrounds itself with an event horizon. This is the ultimate one-way street in the universe. At the event horizon, the gravitational pull of the black hole is so strong that in order to leave, you’d have to travel faster than light does. Since traveling faster than the speed of light is utterly forbidden, anything that crosses the threshold is doomed forever. Hence, a black hole. These simple yet surprising statements have held up to decades of observations. Astronomers have watched as the atmosphere of a star gets sucked into a black hole. They\\'ve seen stars orbit black holes. Physicists on Earth have heard the gravitational waves emitted when black holes collide. We’ve even taken a picture of a black hole’s \"shadow\" — the hole it carves out from the glow of surrounding gas. Related: The 12 strangest objects in the universe And yet, mysteries remain at the very heart of \\xa0black hole science. The very property that defines a black hole — the singularity — seems to be physically impossible, because matter can’t actually collapse down to an infinitely tiny point. That means the current understanding of black holes will eventually need to be updated or replaced with something else that can explain what\\'s at the center of a black hole. But that doesn’t stop physicists from trying. One theory of black hole singularities replaces those infinitely tiny points of infinitely compressed matter with something much more palatable: an incredibly tiny point of incredibly compressed matter. This is called a Planck core, because the idea theorizes that the matter inside a black hole is compressed all the way down to the smallest possible scale, the Planck length, which is 1.6 * 10^ minus 35 meters. That\\'s … small. With a Planck core, which wouldn’t be a singularity, a black hole would no longer host an event horizon — there would be no place where the gravitational pull exceeds the speed of light. But to outside observers, the gravitational pull would be so strong that it would look and act like an event horizon. Only extremely sensitive observations, which we do not yet have the technology for, would be able to tell the difference. Radical problems require radical solutions, and so replacing “singularity” with “Planck core” isn’t all that far-fetched, even though the theory is barely more than a faint sketch of an outline, one without the physics or mathematics to confidently describe that kind of environment. In other words, Planck cores are the physics equivalent of spitballing ideas. That’s a useful thing to do, because singularities need some serious out-of-the-box thinking. And there might be some bonus side-effects. Like, for example, explaining the mystery of dark matter. Dark matter makes up 85% of the mass of the universe, and yet it never interacts with light. We can only determine its existence through its gravitational effects on normal, luminous matter. For example, we can watch stars orbit the centers of the galaxies, and use their orbital speeds to calculate the total amount of mass in those galaxies. In a new paper, submitted Feb. 15 to the preprint database arXiv, physicist Igor Nikitin at the Fraunhofer Institute for Scientific Algorithms and Computing in Germany \\xa0takes the “radical singularity” idea and kicks it up a notch. According to the paper, Planck cores may emit particles (because there’s no event horizon, these black holes aren’t completely black). Those particles could be familiar or something new. Perhaps, they would be some form of particle that could explain dark matter. If black holes are really Planck stars, Nikitin wrote, and they are constantly emitting a stream of dark matter, they could explain the motions of stars within galaxies. his idea probably won\\'t hold up to further scrutiny (there’s much more evidence for the existence of dark matter than just its effect on the motion of stars). But it’s a great example of how we need to come up with as many ideas as possible to explain black holes, because we never know what links there may be to other unsolved mysteries in the universe.

       "  'Title': 'Scientists still stuck on Betelgeuse antics a year after strange dimming episode',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'A year ago, the bright red star Betelgeuse in the Orion constellation hit the headlines when stargazers noticed a stark fading episode that astronomers couldn\\'t explain. They still can\\'t, although they keep trying. The suspense is particularly high now, since the star, which typically dims and brightens on a regular schedule, should soon start to fade again, for the first time since last year\\'s strange antics. Scientists hope that this year\\'s observations of Betelgeuse will put last year\\'s episode in context, which could shape astronomers\\' understanding of stellar activities more generally. \\xa0One such astronomer shared an update at the 237th meeting of the American Astronomical Society, held virtually in January, in advance of the dimming predicted to occur this April. \"We want to see whether last year was really unique,\" Andrea Dupree, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told Space.com after the conference. \"What if it happens again? Then, I don\\'t know,\" she said. \"I don\\'t know if it\\'s going to be a once-in-a-lifetime [event] or whether it\\'s going to happen again or whether it\\'s now in a new phase and what this means.\" Related: Orion and its dimming star Betelgeuse shine over a stargazer in this sentimental night-sky photo What she and her colleagues do know is that scientists have been recording detailed observations of Betelgeuse for 150 years, and nowhere in those records does there appear anything like last year\\'s fading event. Usually, the star dims and brightens over a cycle of about 420 days in a breath-like rhythm, growing and shrinking in size and luminosity alike. But in December 2019, skywatchers noticed something strange was happening as Betelgeuse began to dim. \"It\\'s never been as faint as it was last February,\" Dupree said. Even just stargazing, catching sight of Betelgeuse from Honolulu in early January during the 235th American Astronomical Society meeting, the difference was clear, she said. \"The constellation just looked weird, absolutely weird. The bright red star in the shoulder of Orion was not there, it was fainter than the others. That\\'s not how it\\'s supposed to be.\" Some observers hoped it was a sign that humans were about to get a front seat to Betelgeuse\\'s dramatic demise. As an old, red supergiant, according to NASA, Betelgeuse is doomed to a messy fate: when the star runs out of fuel, it will explode in a brilliant supernova, spewing its innards across the cosmic neighborhood. (In fact, the star may have done so already, and scientists are just waiting to see the aftermath.) Dupree didn\\'t think that was the most likely scenario for last year\\'s antics. But if scientists do indeed catch Betelgeuse at the perfect time, just before it explodes, the observations would be unprecedented. \"Nobody knows what a star does right before it goes supernova,\" Dupree said. \"People have looked maybe six months before or two years before, but until we have a nightly survey of the whole sky and all the sky, we don\\'t have any information on what happens the night before it blows up.\" Even if no supernova materializes soon, more observations of bright Betelgeuse are still helpful, particularly when the star is doing anything unusual. \"The sun is really the only star that we can see in detail and see what happens, and Betelgeuse is the next best candidate,\" Dupree said.  In particular, she hopes that Betelgeuse could teach astronomers about stellar outbursts. Using Hubble Space Telescope observations gathered in the fall of 2019, before Betelgeuse began dimming, scientists concluded that the star spit out a huge wad of dense gas, Dupree said. That in and of itself isn\\'t too unusual, although strangely, this outburst came from a different region of the star than scientists have previously observed, Dupree said. She suspects that as that mass kept moving away from Betelgeuse, it slowly cooled into dust — dust that she believes would have caused the apparent fading that was so striking last year. Other astronomers think that ejection was a coincidence, and that a large cool spot on the star\\'s surface caused the strange fading. Dupree\\'s hope is that observing Betelgeuse this year could help scientists distinguish between those two scenarios and tackle additional questions like the strange location of the outburst. \"How does the star lose material?\" she said. \"Does it flow gently? Does it come out in bursts? Does it come from various parts of the star? How does it change as it moves from the surface of the star, which is hot, out into the interstellar medium, which is cold?\" Conveniently, last year\\'s dimming occurred about halfway through a three-year program in which Dupree had already arranged for the Hubble Space Telescope to check in on Betelgeuse four times a year. It\\'s some of those Hubble observations that spotted the mass of material moving out from the star before its dimming began. Most recently, Hubble checked in on the star in February; the last of the allotted observations will occur in April, Dupree said, although she plans to request additional time with Hubble given the star\\'s recent activity. But Betelgeuse is a tricky target; from late April to late August, it is too close to the sun in our skies for Hubble and ground-based instruments to see it, Dupree said. That\\'s particularly inconvenient given that the star\\'s usual cycle of about 240 days would put it at its dimmest just as humans can\\'t see it. In between Hubble observations last summer, Dupree enlisted NASA\\'s sun spacecraft STEREO-A, located about a third of an orbit behind Earth. When the sun blocks Betelgeuse from Earth, the spacecraft has a clear view of the star. The spacecraft will make another four or five such observations this summer, after Hubble\\'s last opportunity to see the star this spring. For now, the star continues to keep astronomers on their toes. \"Betelgeuse is \\'quiet,\\'\" Dupree wrote in an email update on March 1, adding that she\\'s beginning to suspect the star won\\'t make its predicted April fade, according to the schedule it had been following for so many years. \"Maybe that outburst in 2019 changed its personality!\" Whether Betelgeuse fades or not, Dupree and her colleagues will be watching, eager to hone in on the star\\'s secrets. \"We shall see,\" she said, \"that\\'s what\\'s always fun!\" Email Meghan Bartels at mbartels@space.com or follow her on Twitter @meghanbartels.

       "  'Title': \"Sherlock Holmes' famous memory trick really works\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Sherlock Holmes remembers everything by imagining that he\\'s storing bits of information in a \"memory palace,\" a technique that originated in ancient Greece. Now, researchers have found that this method really does work to create long-lasting memories. Users of the mnemonic technique, called the \"method of loci,\" mentally navigate around a familiar place, such as a path (or Holmes\\' palace). To remember a piece of information, you \"drop\" it along the path and later retrace your steps and \"pick it up.\" For example, if you\\'re very familiar with Central Park in New York City, you can imagine walking through it, dropping the word \"book\" at the Boat House, then the word \"water bottle\" at the next bend, then the word \"space\" at the fountain. When you want to remember the words, you imagine retracing your exact steps. By training with this method, the world\\'s best memory champions can remember inordinate amounts of information, like word lists, digit series and decks of cards, according to the study. But the World Memory Championships test only short-term memory and only a handful of studies have looked into the brain as people use this method to improve memory. Related Content: 6 fun ways to sharpen your memory \"We became fascinated by how such extraordinary memory performance as shown in the World Memory Championships is possible,\" said lead author Isabella Wagner, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Vienna. (One of the study co-authors, Boris Konrad — a researcher at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour in Nijmegen, Netherlands — is a memory champion himself.) The method of the loci uses well-known places or routes as a \"scaffold\" or \"structure\" to embed novel, unrelated information, Wagner said. The combination of prior knowledge — the familiar route — and the novel information \"is very powerful to boost memory,\" she added. To evaluate the method of loci, Wagner and her team enrolled 17 \"memory athletes,\" or champions who were ranked among the world\\'s top 50 in memory competitions, and 16 others that matched the athletes in characteristics such as age and intelligence. The researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of the participants\\' brains while asking them to study random words on a list. Then, the researchers presented the participants with three words at a time from the list and asked them to recall if the words were in the same order as previously studied. In the second part of the study, they enrolled 50 participants who previously had no experience in mnemonics and trained 17 of them for six weeks to recall memories using the method of loci. The rest of the participants were in the control group (16 of them were \"active controls\" which meant they were trained using a different memory tactic called \"working memory training,\" and 17 were \"passive controls,\" meaning they weren\\'t trained at all). They again scanned the participants\\' brains with fMRI as they performed the same tasks, both before and after training. The researchers also asked the participants to recall which words were on the list 20 minutes and 24 hours after their fMRI scans. The team used this test to define \"weak memories,\" or those that could be remembered after 20 minutes but not after 24 hours, and \"durable memories,\" or those that could be remembered 24 hours later. Four months later, the researchers retested the participants\\' ability to memorize and recall words. As expected, the participants showed better, longer-lasting memory after training with the method of loci than after training with the other memory technique or with no technique at all. The participants who trained with the ancient method showed a significant increase in durable memories, but not a significant change in weak memories (or short-term memories that faded after 20 minutes), compared with the control groups. After 20 minutes, the people who were trained with the method of loci remembered about 62 words from the list, whereas those who were trained with the other method remembered 41 and those who weren\\'t trained at all remembered 36. After 24 hours, the people who were trained with the method of loci remembered about 56 words, versus 30 and 21 in the control groups, respectively. Four months later, people who were trained with the method of the loci could remember about 50 words, versus 30 and 27 in the control groups, respectively. What\\'s more, world memory champions and the participants who trained with the method of loci showed similar brain activity as they memorized word lists and ordering. The team also came across something unexpected: While both the world champions and the \\xa0participants were partaking in these tasks, activity in their brains declined in regions typically involved in memory processing and long-term memory, Wagner told Live Science in an email. \"This was somewhat surprising to us, as better performance is typically associated with increased engagement of different brain regions,\" she said. — 10 things you didn\\'t know about the brain — 5 experts answer: What\\'s the best way to improve my memory? — 5 ways to beef up your brain In other words, they found that less brain activation led to better memory, which may be because the method of loci prompts the brain to work more efficiently, Wagner said. In addition, while the participants rested, those who had been trained with the method of loci had increases in brain connectivity between other reasons important for storing long-term memory. Almost anyone can learn to use the method of the loci, Wagner said. \"It obviously requires time and regular practice and might thus not be suited for everyone, but it is definitely possible to \\'boost\\' memory and reach high, or even exceptional, memory performance.\" The researchers didn\\'t test how this training might generalize to other situations, such as remembering things other than words. Nor is it clear if the technique might help to ease cognitive decline during healthy aging or if it might be helpful for preventing or slowing disease, Wagner said. \"However, we are quite excited about these results, and a whole avenue of new questions opens up that should give future studies ample material to investigate,\" she said. The findings were published Wednesday (March 3) in the journal Science Advances. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Skeletons of WWII-era nuns murdered by Soviets unearthed in Poland',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Archaeologists recently unearthed the skeletons of three Catholic nuns who were murdered by Soviet soldiers at the end of World War II. Their discovery concludes a months-long search for the bones of seven nuns who were killed during the former Soviet Union\\'s brutal occupation of the war-torn country. Russia\\'s Red Army invaded Poland in 1944, as Nazi Germany withdrew their soldiers. During that time, Soviet forces sought to seize control by suppressing Polish militia and religious figures, imprisoning, deporting and killing Polish soldiers, clergy and civilians. Records from 1945 documented Soviet soldiers slaughtering seven nuns in the order of St. Catherine of Alexandria, representatives of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) told Live Science in an email. To find out where these murdered nuns were buried, archaeologists first excavated a site in Gdańsk in July 2020, where they found the remains of Sister Charytyna (Jadwiga Fahl), according to a statement from the IPN. An excavation in Olsztyn in October revealed what are thought to be the remains of Sister Generosa (Maria Bolz), Sister Krzysztofora (Marta Klomfass) and Sister Liberia (Maria Domnik), all of whom were nurses at Olsztyn\\'s St. Mary\\'s Hospital. Related: Photos: Mass graves hold 17th-century prisoners of war To find the remaining three nuns, archaeologists in December excavated a site in a municipal cemetery in Orneta that measured about 215 square feet (20 square meters), using local archival records, such as a hand-drawn burial plan, to find the nuns\\' bodies. To reach the graves from 1945, they first had to exhume more recent burials that were on top of them. The remains they eventually found are thought to belong to the last three nuns in the group: Sister Rolanda (Maria Abraham), Sister Gunhilda (Dorota Steffen) and Sister Bona (Anna Pestka), according to a separate IPN statement. Historic documents, the age and sex of the remains, and the presence of numerous religious objects indicated that the skeletons belonged to the murdered nuns, the IPN said. The religious artifacts included articles of clothing associated with the St. Catherine order, small rosaries with polished beads, larger rosaries for wearing on a belt, a cross inlaid with metal designs and two medallions \"with images of the holy family,\" IPN representatives said in the email.  When the Germans began retreating from Poland in 1944, Russia seized the chance to take control of the country. \"Mass terror ensued in the territory occupied by the Soviets,\" according to the Warsaw Institute, a geopolitical think tank in Poland. As the Red Army advanced into cities and territories, soldiers looted and burned churches and religious buildings, and nuns were treated \"with particular cruelty,\" IPN representatives said. In February 1945, Russian forces descended upon hospitals in Gdańsk-Wrzeszcz, Olsztyn and Orneta, where nuns in the St. Catherine order served as nurses. Soldiers beat and stabbed patients and attacked the nuns who intervened, causing horrific injuries; Sister Rolanda\\'s face \"was mutilated and swollen beyond recognition,\" and Sister Gunhilda was shot three times, according to the IPN.  – In photos: \\'Demon burials\\' discovered in Poland cemetery – Soviets hid nuclear bunkers in Poland\\'s forests (photos) – Understanding the 10 most destructive human behaviors Sister Krzysztofora died after \"a long fight with a Soviet soldier,\" the IPN reported. At the time of her death, her eyes were gouged out, her tongue was cut off and she had been stabbed with a bayonet 16 times, according to the statement. DNA analysis of the seven skeletons is underway at the Forensic Medicine Institute in Gdańsk to confirm the nuns\\' identities, and Catholic clergy in Poland are seeking beatification for the murdered St. Catherine sisters, according to the IPN.

       "  'Full Article': 'An asteroid the size of the Eiffel Tower will zip past Earth Friday (March 5) and be out of our planetary neighborhood until 2029. The space rock, dubbed Apophis (an ancient Egyptian demon), was first spotted in 2004 and won\\'t pose any danger to Earth during this week\\'s flyby; it will travel past the planet at a little more than 40 times the distance from Earth to the moon. But scientists are using this week as a dress rehearsal for the asteroid\\'s next pass, on April 13, 2029, when Apophis will get as close to Earth as some of the highest-orbit satellites. Related: Top 10 ways to destroy Earth \"Apophis in 2029 is going to be a really incredible observing opportunity for us,\" Marina Brozović, a radar scientist at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, told Live Science\\'s sister site Space.com. \"But before we get to 2029, we are preparing.\" Apophis is 1,120 feet (340-meter-wide) wide and made of rock, iron and nickel. It is probably shaped roughly like a peanut, though astronomers will have a better idea of its form when it passes by Earth this week, according to NASA. The asteroid takes a full orbit around the sun about every 11 months. On March 5, it will come within 10,471,577\\xa0miles\\xa0(16,852,369 km) of Earth at 8:15 p.m. EST (0115 GMT on March 6). That\\'s too far to be seen with the naked eye, but scientists will use planetary radar to image Apophis as it flies by using NASA\\'s Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California and the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. They hope to determine the asteroid\\'s shape and learn more about the way it rotates. \"We know Apophis is in a very complicated spin state, it\\'s sort of spinning and tumbling at the same time,\" Richard Binzel, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Space.com.  This planetary radar study will provide researchers a baseline for the much closer fly-by in 2029, when Apophis will get as close as 19,800 miles (31,900 kilometers) to Earth. That\\'s close enough that Earth\\'s gravity might change the shape of the asteroid or scatter the boulders on its surface. How and if the asteroid changes as it flies by will help reveal details about the asteroid\\'s inner structure, Binzel said. At its closest approach in 2029, Apophis will be briefly visible to the naked eye over western Australia, growing as bright as the stars in the Big Dipper. It will be closest to Earth at 6 p.m. EDT on April 13, 2029, when it will be over the Atlantic -- an ocean it will cross in only an hour. The asteroid will cross over the United States by 7 p.m. EDT. Apophis is named after an ancient Egyptian demon who personified chaos and evil, largely because astronomers initially calculated that there was a 3% chance the asteroid could impact Earth on its 2029 flyby. They\\'ve now shown that the asteroid won\\'t collide with Earth in 2029, nor on its next pass in 2036. There\\'s still a slight chance that the asteroid could hit Earth in 2068, but the 2021 and 2029 flybys should give astronomers more information with which to calculate Apophis\\' future.

The earthquake was the strongest one to strike anywhere in the world since May 2019, when an 8.0-magntidue earthquake struck Peru, the Post reported. New Zealand is situated on the edge of the boundary between the Pacific tectonic plate and the Australian tectonic plate.

       "  'Title': 'Shark gets stabbed in the head, washes ashore in Los Cabos',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'On a sunny day in February, a strange sight washed ashore on a beach in Los Cabos, Mexico: a dead shortfin mako shark that had been stabbed in the head. The weapon was still embedded in the young shark\\'s head, but it\\'s a mystery \"whodunnit.\" Quite a few marine animals have pointy \"swords\" that they typically wield in self-defense. Based on the size of this particular spike, it could have been a marlin, a sailfish or even a stingray, all underwater inhabitants of the Los Cabos region, said Christopher Lowe, a professor of marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, who examined photos of the stabbed shark. Adult mako sharks eat \"sword\"-bearing animals all the time. What likely happened here is that this juvenile shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) attempted to grab a meal but was unsuccessful, Lowe said. \"This one was a young one — probably inexperienced and trying to take on prey that it wasn\\'t really ready for,\" Lowe told Live Science. Adult shortfin mako sharks can reach 12 feet (3.8 meters) in length and weigh at least at least 1,200 pounds (545 kilograms). But these sharks are born at about 3 feet (1 m) long, and this shark is only a bit longer than that, according to its photo, which is about the size of a 3-foot-wide (1 m) adult stingray. Related: In photos: Mexico\\'s new ocean reserve protects stunning biodiversity The incident happened on Feb. 18, according to Arturo Chacon, who spotted the shark when he was walking along the beach in San José del Cabo, which, along with Cabo San Lucas, is known as Los Cabos, a popular tourist destination in northwestern Mexico. \"It looked like it was fresh or that it lost its life not too long ago,\" Chacon, the owner and CEO of Tag Cabo Sportfishing, told Live Science. He snapped a few photos of the shark and posted them on Instagram, writing, \"A shark that washed out on the beach in San Jose del Cabo. Apparently because it lost a battle with a big stingray! Woow!\"  While it\\'s not clear what animal stabbed the shark, stingrays do have serrated, pointy spines. If it was a stingray, it was likely a pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea), a creature with a dark purplish to gray underside and a defensive spine, also known as a barb, on its tail that it uses to impale animals threatening it, Lowe said. The pelagic stingray lives in the open water, and its habitat overlaps with that of the shortfin mako shark, Lowe noted. Stingray spines are venomous but rarely fatal, Lowe said. There are exceptions, however; in 2006, Australian television personality Steve Irwin, known for his popular show \"The Crocodile Hunter,\" died when the venomous spine of a short-tail stingray (Dasyatis brevicaudata) pierced his heart. But it\\'s not uncommon to see live sharks riddled with stingray spines: \"In one shark, we\\'ve seen probably 15 to 20 spines,\" Lowe said.  Stingrays can get spined, too. Females sometimes use their spines to ward off amorous males, and once a stingray uses a spine, it can grow another, Lowe said. \"If females are done mating, and males try to mate with them, they\\'ll spine the crap out of them,\" Lowe said. \"You\\'ll see males with all these holes in them.\"  So, if spines usually aren\\'t lethal, what killed the young mako? Judging from the photos Chacon took, it doesn\\'t look like the spine pierced the shark\\'s brain, Lowe said. \"It\\'s hard to tell for sure, but [the spine] is so far forward — the brain is back more, kind of between the eyes,\" Lowe said. \"Sharks\\' brains are weird. There\\'s a lot of space and not a lot of brain in there. There\\'s a lot of fluid that fills the chondrocranium, which is the braincase, and then the brain is relatively small.\" Related: In photos: Glow-in-the-dark sharks It\\'s possible the spine damaged part of the shark\\'s forebrain or olfactory lobes, \"so it might have affected its ability to smell,\" Lowe said. \"Whether that was lethal or not, we\\'d have to do a necropsy [an animal autopsy] on it.\" —Photos: Orcas are chowing down on great-white-shark organs —In photos: \\'Faceless\\' fish rediscovered after more than a century —Images: Stingray sex, mini-horses & other curiosities of Fossil Lake What\\'s surprising here is that the shark was found on the beach. Sharks are negatively buoyant, so they usually sink to the ocean floor when they\\'re dying, Lowe said. \"What I would infer based on this wound is that the animal was disoriented and swam into the shoreline, where it beached itself,\" he said. Or, perhaps after the shark was stabbed, \"a fisherman caught it and it got off the hook, but it was so beat up, it just didn\\'t make it,\" Lowe said. After analyzing the photos more, Lowe said the spine might not belong to the pelagic stingray. \"Stingray barbs tend to be more oblong or flattened, but this looks too thick in diameter,\" he later wrote to Live Science in an email. \"Another possibility is it is the tip of the bill from a marlin or sailfish.\" These sword-carrying fish are known to stab sharks that are trying to eat them, Lowe said. But that\\'s not always the case. In 2020, a thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus), a shark that doesn\\'t prey on swordfish, washed ashore in Libya with a sword sticking out of its body, a study in the journal Ichthyological Research reported. It\\'s unknown what happened, but scientists suggested that maybe the stabbing was accidental or that the swordfish attacked the shark because the two animals were competing for the same prey, Live Science previously reported.

In February, four orangutans and five bonobos at the zoo each received two doses of the vaccine, which was developed by the veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis, according to National Geographic. The zoo reached out to Zoetis after several of the gorillas at their safari park tested positive for COVID-19 in January, and the company responded by providing a small supply of their vaccine, according to a statement from Zoetis. \"This isn\\'t the norm. In my career, I haven\\'t had access to an experimental vaccine this early in the process and haven\\'t had such an overwhelming desire to want to use one,\" Nadine Lamberski, chief conservation and wildlife health officer at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, told National Geographic. One gorilla is also scheduled to be vaccinated at the zoo, but since many of the gorillas there have already tested positive and recovered from COVID-19, they are a lower priority for vaccination right now, according to The New York Times. —Why cats and dogs may need their own COVID-19 vaccines —Coronavirus could be catastrophic for great apes, experts warn —20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history But Zoetis plans to provide more vaccines to the San Diego Zoo and other zoos once they have a bigger supply of their vaccine, the Times reported. Zoetis initially developed their COVID-19 vaccine for use in dogs and cats, but then shifted to studying the vaccine in mink after large outbreaks occurred on mink farms last year. The vaccine is still experimental — it has not yet been approved for use in animals in the U.S., but the company is currently in talks with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval of its COVID-19 vaccine in minks, the statement said. Zoetis\\'s vaccine is similar to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine for humans, which delivers a modified version of the coronavirus\\'s \"spike protein,\" according to Science Magazine.

Made from a tangled mess of magnetic field lines and fast-flying solar wind, the hurricane was invisible to the naked eye — however, four weather satellites that passed over the North Pole detected a formation not unlike a typical terrestrial hurricane, the study authors wrote. The space hurricane was shaped like a funnel with a quiet \"eye\" at the center, surrounded by several counterclockwise-spinning spiral arms of plasma (ionized gas found all over the solar system, including in Earth\\'s atmosphere). Instead of raining water, the space hurricane rained electrons directly into Earth\\'s upper atmosphere. \"Until now, it was uncertain that space plasma hurricanes even existed, so to prove this with such a striking observation is incredible,\" study co-author Mike Lockwood, space scientist at the University of Reading in the U.K., said in a statement. \"Tropical storms are associated with huge amounts of energy, and these space hurricanes must be created by unusually large and rapid transfer of solar wind energy and charged particles into the Earth\\'s upper atmosphere.\" Using a 3D model of the hurricane, the researchers hypothesized that the formation resulted from a complex interaction between incoming solar wind (high-speed gales of plasma periodically released by the sun) and the magnetic field over the North Pole.

       "  'Full Article': 'Capturing lightning in a bottle is the very definition of a tough task, but now physicists have found a way to contain ultracold plasma in a magnetic bottle trap, a breakthrough that could bring physicists one step closer to understanding solar winds and achieving nuclear fusion. Plasma is one of the four states of matter, consisting of positive ions and negative free electrons. But unlike solids, liquids and gases, its tendency to occur in only the most extreme places, such as in the streak of ionized air we call a lightning bolt, in the dancing pattern of the aurora borealis, or on the surface of the sun, makes it extremely difficult to study. This difficulty is only worsened by the fact that the plasmas in the Northern Lights or on the sun\\'s surface interact with a complex magnetic field in ways scientists have yet to fully understand. Related: 9 cool facts about magnets \"Throughout the sun\\'s atmosphere, the (strong) magnetic field has the effect of altering everything relative to what you would expect without a magnetic field, but in very subtle and complicated ways that can really trip you up if you don\\'t have a really good understanding of it,\" study co-author Peter Bradshaw, an astrophysicist at Rice University in Houston, said in a statement. Colder particles move slower, allowing much more precise measurements of their behavior. In order to figure out how plasmas interact with magnetic fields, the scientists cooled their plasma, made of strontium, down to about 1 degree above absolute zero (around minus 272 degrees Celsius) using a technique called laser-cooling. You\\'d think that firing a laser at something would heat it up, but if the photons (light particles) in the laser beam are traveling in the opposite direction of the moving plasma particles, they can actually cause those plasma particles to slow and cool them down. Once the plasma was cooled, the researchers trapped it momentarily with forces from surrounding magnets, allowing them to study it before it dissipated. They then set out to disentangle the interaction between the ions and electrons of the plasma and the magnetic field, which varies greatly across the plasma. The interaction was so complex that it took them a year to fully interpret their data.  \"We measure plasma properties by scattering light off the ions in the plasma, but the magnetic field really complicates that,\" Rice Dean of Natural Sciences and corresponding author Tom Killian told Live Science. This is because the magnetic field changes how the ions scatter the laser light in very unpredictable ways. \"On top of that, the magnetic field is varying in space all across the plasma,” said Killian. “We had to sort out all of those effects.\" to paint a picture of the plasma density and speed across the bottle over time. The picture they revealed was one where the fast-moving, low-mass electrons were tightly pinned to the magnetic field lines and spiraling around them, with the positive ions held inside the trap by their attraction to the negatively charged electrons. The paper\\'s authors speculate that the magnetic field kept the electrons and ions from combining to form neutral atoms, and so kept the soup trapped in its plasma state. — Northern lights: 8 dazzling facts about auroras — 18 biggest unsolved mysteries in physics — What\\'s that? Your physics questions answered The trapping technique opens up a wide range of avenues for plasma research. If physicists can capture ultra-cold plasma in a bottle, they can study the behavior of plasma-composed stellar objects like white dwarfs, or begin to replicate the conditions for fusion inside the sun. Next, the researchers said they will design a laser grid that will plug any holes in the bottle\\'s magnetic field through which ions could escape the experiment. They also hope to further investigate the processes that occur inside the trapped plasma, such as how the ions and electrons could recombine or how energy and mass move through the system. \"Our new abilities may give a great opportunity to study those phenomena,\" Killian said. \"Similar effects are probably important for understanding some other systems that are hard to do experiments on, like white dwarf stars.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': 'Sesame seed-size brains created from a mix of human and Neanderthal genes lived briefly in petri dishes in a University of California, San Diego laboratory, offering tantalizing clues as to how the organs have evolved over millennia. Scientists have long wondered how human beings evolved to have such big, complex brains. One way to figure that out is by comparing modern genes involved in brain development with those found in our ancient cousins. Though scientists have found plenty of fossilized remains from Neanderthals — cousins of modern humans that died out about 37,000 years ago — they have yet to find a preserved Neanderthal brain. To bridge that gap in knowledge, a research team grew tiny, unconscious \"minibrains\" in petri dishes. Some of the brains were grown using standard human genes, and others were altered using the gene-editing tool CRISPR to have a brain development gene taken from Neanderthal remains. Related: 11 body parts grown in the lab It\\'s not the first time tiny brains have been grown for research, as Live Science has reported, but it is the first time anyone has cultivated a hybrid of the human organ with an ancient human cousin. —In photos: A nearly complete human ancestor skull —Photos: Looking for extinct humans in ancient cave mud —3D images: exploring the human brain Specifically, the researchers replaced the human NOVA1 gene in some of the stem cells used to grow the minibrains with a NOVA1 gene pieced together from genetic remnants in the bones of long-dead Neanderthals. NOVA1, researchers know, plays a role in brain development. The difference between the completely human brain and the human-Neanderthal hybrid was immediately obvious, Alysson Muotri, a neuroscientist at UCSD who led the project, told Nature. Human minibrains tend to be smooth spheres, like little marbles. The Neanderthal brains were smaller and more irregular, the researchers reported. They also took longer to develop. Anyone looking at the different petri dishes could immediately spot the difference, the researchers said. A closer analysis revealed that the part-Neanderthal minibrains were more chaotic in their neural activity and produced different sets of proteins than the all-human ones Moutri and her team chose NOVA1 for their experiment because it plays a role in forming the connections between nerves, and because damage to this gene can lead to neurological disorders — making it a key target of study for researchers hoping to understand the brain. Neanderthal NOVA1 genes are also relatively easy to synthesize. Only one letter in their genetic code is different from the human variant. NPR reported that the differences suggest Neanderthal brains matured more quickly than human brains did, making Neanderthals more capable at younger ages. But that quick development robbed Neanderthals of the extended development period that likely gave human children advantages in complex thought and social bonding.

       "  'Title': 'Primate ancestor of all humans likely roamed with the dinosaurs',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Scientists have identified the earliest primate fossils: tiny ancient teeth from a rat-size creature that suggest our ancient ancestors once lived alongside the dinosaurs. The teeth are 0.08 inches (2 millimeters) long and are from the oldest group of primates, known as plesiadapiforms. They were found in the Fort Union Formation in northeastern Montana in the 1980s, but have now been formally identified in a new study, published Feb. 24 in the journal Royal Society Open Science. These early primates represent life beginning to recover after the giant asteroid slammed into Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period about 66 million years ago, causing a mass extinction that wiped out nonavian dinosaurs. The researchers dated the fossils to between 105,000 and 139,000 years after the extinction event; but these creatures likely evolved from an unknown ancestor primate that lived alongside the dinosaurs, the researchers said. \"It\\'s our lineage, so it has a special meaning to us. And to think about, you know, our earliest ancestors at this time in northeastern Montana living alongside dinosaurs perhaps and then surviving this [extinction] event is pretty breathtaking to me,\" co-lead author Gregory Wilson Mantilla, a professor in the Department of Biology at the University of Washington and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the university\\'s Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, told Live Science. Related: Photos: Fossils reveal pint-size primate Plesiadapiforms are the ancestors of all modern primates, including humans. The five fossils in the new study belong to a genus called Purgatorius — named after fossils found on Purgatory Hill in Montana, which included those from members of the oldest and most primitive Plesiadapiform family, Purgatoriidae, and, therefore key to understanding how early primates evolved. The research team analyzed the tiny teeth with CT scans, using X-rays to create 3D images of body parts; they produced larger copies using a 3D printer for easier examination. Two of the teeth came from the species Purgatorius janisae, and the other three teeth have been assigned to a new species named Purgatorius mckeeveri. The newly described P. mckeeveri is named after Frank McKeever, who was one of the first residents of the area where the fossils were found and whose family has supported the fieldwork there, according to a statement released by the University of Washington. P. mckeeveri had inflated and rounded cusps on its teeth, which were suitable for crushing fruits, whereas the sharper teeth of P. janisae were better for eating insects. The two species, however, were related and likely looked very similar, perhaps even indistinguishable, Mantilla said.  \"They were probably quite squirrel-like in appearance,\" Mantilla said. They had much longer snouts compared with those of modern short-faced primates, he added, and their eyes were on the sides of their heads, as they relied more heavily on their sense of smell. The researchers helped to create a reconstruction of P. mckeeveri based on information gathered from the teeth and what is known about Purgatorius, and their close relatives, from previous fossil discoveries, such as ankle bones. The fossils were found in rock estimated to be about 65.9 million years old. The ancient teeth may help scientists like Mantilla understand how life survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction and recovered through the Paleogene period (about 66 million to 23 million years ago) and beyond. \"What we\\'re seeing is that part of this recovery strongly involved our lineage,\" Mantilla said. Primates were among the first major group to flourish, by finding gaps in the rebounding ecosystems. \"They were living in the trees, whereas most mammals were living low on the ground,\" Mantilla said. — In photos: A nearly complete human ancestor skull — Ancient footprints to tiny \\'vampires\\': 8 rare and unusual fossils — Photos: Looking for extinct humans in ancient cave mud Mary Silcox, a professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Toronto Scarborough who focuses on plesiadapiforms, said the study was \"very exciting.\" To have identifiable primates from the very earliest periods of the Paleogene clearly suggests that placental mammals must have started to diversify in the last days of the nonavian dinosaurs, Silcox told Live Science in an email. \"The fact that this material comes from North America is also significant, supporting the importance of this continent in the earliest phases of primate evolution.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': \"'Gravity portals' could morph dark matter into ordinary matter, astrophysicists propose\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Astrophysicists have an idea that could help to solve two mysteries: the reason for the bizarre abundance of super-high-energy radiation shooting from the center of our galaxy and the identity of invisible stuff called dark matter that has perplexed the world since its discovery some 50 years ago. And the idea has a super-cool name: gravity portals. The idea goes, when two dark matter particles (whatever they are) get sucked into one of these portals, they obliterate each other and spit out shockingly strong gamma rays. This line of thinking can potentially explain why the galactic center — where dense clusters of dark matter are thought to lurk — is full of gamma rays; and it could shed light on how the dark matter behaves and might occasionally interact with the normal matter of our universe. Related: The 11 biggest unanswered questions about dark matter More than 80% of the matter in our universe is of a form unknown to the standard model of particle physics. Scientists call it \"dark matter,\" because it does not interact with light. The first hint of dark matter\\'s existence came in the 1970s, when astronomer Vera Rubin noticed that galaxies were rotating far too quickly — without an additional, hidden source of gravity, they should have torn themselves apart eons ago. For decades, astronomers didn\\'t know if they needed to change their understanding of gravity, add more regular-but-really-dim matter to the universe, or include a brand new ingredient. But year after year, observation after observation have limited the choices. No theory of modified gravity can explain all observations. And physicists have placed firm limits on the amount of normal matter (bright, dim and everything in between) in the cosmos. That leaves dark matter to explain the speedy galaxies. This matter would be a new kind of particle, with some unknown identity (or identities). It doesn\\'t interact with light, otherwise we would\\'ve seen it by now. It doesn\\'t interact with the strong nuclear force — which binds together particles of matter — otherwise scientists would have detected its influence in atomic experiments. It might talk to the weak nuclear force, but that force is so feeble and short-range that observing any deviations in the expected results is challenging. Trillions of dark matter particles may be streaming through you right now, invisible and silent. However, dark matter betrays its presence through gravity, because every single form of mass and energy in the universe exerts some sort of gravitational influence. So the only surefire way to study dark matter is through its gravitational interactions with normal matter, such as the motions of stars inside galaxies. But there may be another way. In a study published Jan. 28 to the preprint database arXiv, physicists proposed a new theory to explain what dark matter is and how it behaves. But before diving into their idea, we have to introduce one more clue into this dark-matter hunt. The clue comes in the form of a strange abundance of gamma rays observed emanating from the center of our Milky Way galaxy. Related: 11 fascinating facts about our Milky Way galaxy Gamma rays are the highest-energy form of radiation possible, and they usually only come into existence from some seriously high-energy events, such as stars going supernova. But there are more gamma rays than you\\'d expect in the galactic center given how rare such cataclysmic events there are. So, it\\'s possible, this theory proposed, that gamma rays may emerge as a byproduct of high-energy electrons. These high-energy electrons, which are a kind of particle known as \"leptons\" and much easier to produce than gamma rays directly, emanate from some source and travel throughout the galactic center. The electrons themselves are undetectable (they are very, very tiny), but as they flood through interstellar space, they can occasionally slam into a random passing photon (a light particle). That photon, most likely something innocuous and low-energy, collides with the aggressive electron; the collision boosts the photon\\'s energy so much that it begins to give off gamma rays that we can see. Those collisions potentially explain the excess gamma rays, but where do those high-energy electrons come from? Let\\'s recap what we know. One, dark matter interacts only through gravity. Two, high-energy leptons floating around the galactic center could explain the extra gamma rays we see there. Three, because in our own galaxy the core has the highest density of matter, we think that there is also a large concentration of dark matter there. Coincidence? Or conspiracy? The link between these two observations has a suitably awesome name: leptophilic gravity portals, as detailed by Sun Xu-Dong and Dai Ben-Zhong, of the China Key Laboratory of Astroparticle Physics, in their arXiv paper. The study has yet to be peer-reviewed. Let\\'s start with the \"gravity portals\" part. As far as we understand gravity, it just pulls on stuff. Earth pulls on the moon; the sun pulls on Earth; stars in a galaxy pull on each other, and so on. And gravity does a really, really good job of pulling. So on the face of it, the only thing gravity can do to dark matter is … pull. But our understanding of gravity is incomplete. Physics can explain gravity operates on the large scale, but there\\'s no so-called quantum theory of gravity, which would describe strong gravity operating at very tiny scales. And in this regime, gravity might have some surprises in store. The other forces of nature are capable of annihilating, transforming and creating particles all the time. The weak nuclear force, for instance, can change a proton into a neutron, triggering radioactive decay. A particle and its antiparticle can connect via the electromagnetic force, annihilating each other in a burst of radiation. So maybe gravity, in extreme cases, can bring two dark matter particles together and destroy them, turning them into … anything, really. —The 12 strangest objects in the universe —From Big Bang to present: Snapshots of our universe through time —The 18 biggest unsolved mysteries in physics And according to the theoretical model outlined by the researchers, maybe those dark matter particles can transform into leptons. Hence the \"leptophilic\" part of the name, which means \"lepton-loving.\" According to the new theory, dark matter particles can occasionally annihilate each other through nothing more than chance gravitational interactions. These chance interactions are known in the physics jargon as \"gravity portals,\" since they offer a way for particles to interact through gravity alone. The product of that collision is a high-energy electron. These interactions would be much more common in the galactic center, where the density of dark matter is likely highest. Those electrons would then travel on, eventually striking a low-energy photon and turning into a gamma ray, causing the excess that we observe. Yes, this idea is a stretch. But given that physicists are in the dark when it comes to the identity of dark matter, new ideas are always welcome. And this theory was specifically designed to match the observation of the gamma rays. But once that doorway has been opened, allowing dark matter particles to transform into regular matter (leptons, in this case), more theoretical work can be done to see if there are other ways to test the theory.

This crowd-sourced network of smart trackers with \"edge processing\" uploads data of unusual phenomena to a Sky Hub Cloud. The driving forces empowering the Sky Hub initiative center on the rapid growth and evolution of machine learning for streamlining the analysis of large datasets and the increasing affordability of artificial intelligence (AI)-ready hardware. These advancements can be harnessed to probe the ongoing, baffling behavior of UAP and unidentified flying objects (UFOs) reportedly crisscrossing the skies. Related: 7 things most often mistaken for UFOs The mission of Sky Hub is clearcut: Connect a network of civilian-owned sensor arrays, use machine learning to catalogue anomalous events, and share this data with researchers.

The ultimate goal is building and hosting a worldwide, digital UFO database that anyone can access under a Creative Commons License using Sky Hub\\'s open-source software. \"I have long been interested in why certain technologies or scientific concepts were readily accepted by society … while others become flashpoints,\" Cogswell told Space.com. Looking for UAP/UFOs \"is not only an opportunity to make this something interesting, but also useful,\" he added. \"There are lots of reports of objects in the sky that we don\\'t know how to categorize that I think are interesting and worthy of study.\"  Cogswell said that Sky Hub currently has 12 operational units. Most are in the United States, but there are some in the United Kingdom and one in Brazil. For the most part, the units are standard, using a fisheye lens camera and other hardware. Suggested specifications, such as a microcomputer built for machine learning and AI, are posted on the Sky Hub website. \"We don\\'t want to run before we can walk,\" Cogswell said, but new ideas are always welcomed. The cost to assemble a Sky Hub unit for deployment can range from $600 to $1,000. \"We\\'re constantly trying to find cheaper alternatives.

In diving into the UFO/UAP situation, \"we are looking at this from a serious but skeptical perspective,\" Cogswell said. \"In my opinion, there is something interesting happening here that\\'s worth investigating. You can\\'t deny that there are people who still make reports of UFOs every year. If it\\'s all fake, in my mind, that\\'s almost more interesting. How did something untrue become such a social phenomenon like this?\" Related: UFO watch: 8 times the government looked for flying saucers  \"There have been several such projects over the years to attempt to record UFOs,\" said Robert Sheaffer, a noted writer on the topic and a UFO skeptic. There are already numerous networks of meteor cameras set up today across the United States and other countries, he told Space.com. For example, the American Meteor Society maintains an extensive all-sky camera registry. In addition, many astronomy groups and private observatories operate their own sky cameras to record meteorological phenomena and meteors, Sheaffer pointed out. Sheaffer\\'s take-home: \"The people setting up UFO cameras apparently do not realize that there are already extensive automated camera networks all across the globe. But somehow astronomers\\' cameras do not record UFOs, just meteors. Those setting up \\'UFO cameras\\' are fooling themselves if they think they will record objects that astronomers\\' cameras do not.\"  Point of fact: In August of last year, the Pentagon announced the formation of a UAP task force to gain insight into the nature and origins of UFOs. The mission of the task force is to detect, analyze and catalog UAP that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security. Concerning the UAP situation, Scott Miller, chair and professor of aerospace engineering at Wichita State University in Kansas, offers an interesting point of view. \"I have been trying to follow the UAP stories. I suspect many sightings are still related to secret, not necessarily classified, aircraft activities, Miller said. \"Interestingly, I strongly suspect all of the major defense contractors, and many new ones, have expanded their abilities to rapidly prototype vehicles.\" Miller\\'s view focuses on contractors eager to attract U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) dollars by building and flying their own technology demonstrators. \"There are likely lots of non-government funded vehicles that have, are, or will be flying,\" he said. There are some UAP sightings that are very interesting, and potentially not related to new secret aircraft, Miller said. \"However, keep in mind that if we had seen an early Have Blue stealth fighter back in the \\'70s, we would have said there is no way it\\'s an airplane.\" The famous Navy \"Tic Tac\" UAP videos are interesting and perplexing, Miller said, but there are a number of things he\\'s confused about. \"Specifically, why is it only the Navy that has seen the Tic Tacs?

       "  'Full Article': 'NASA\\'s Perseverance rover continues to get up to speed on the Red Planet. Since Perseverance\\'s picture-perfect landing on Feb. 18, the rover team has been methodically checking out its seven science instruments and various subsystems. For example, Perseverance just deployed its wind sensor, as before-and-after photos captured by the six-wheeled robot\\'s navigation cameras show. The wind sensor is part of Perseverance\\'s weather station, which is called the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA). The instrument will monitor air temperature, humidity, radiation, dust and wind at Perseverance\\'s landing site, the floor of Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide (45 kilometers) hole in the ground that harbored a deep lake and a river delta in the ancient past. Live updates: NASA\\'s Perseverance Mars rover mission Congrats to the MEDA team! Look what just deployed!! The wind sensor! @estrellasycafe You must be so stoked!

But that main science work won\\'t start immediately after the rover gets up and running; Perseverance\\'s first big job will be to find an airfield where its little helicopter buddy can take off. That helicopter, a 4-lb. (1.8 kilograms) craft named Ingenuity, journeyed to Mars on Perseverance\\'s belly. Ingenuity will deploy at the airfield and try to make the first-ever rotorcraft flights on a world beyond Earth, demonstrating technology that could pave the way for a whole new Mars exploration strategy.  Ingenuity\\'s flights will likely take place this spring, with science and sampling work commencing in earnest in the summer, mission team members have said. But Perseverance\\'s early days on Mars are far from boring. The rover team has already posted more than 6,300 of the rover\\'s Jezero photos, many of them spectacular high-resolution shots taken with Perseverance\\'s Mastcam-Z camera system.

       "  'Full Article': 'A teen who had experienced years of nasal congestion along with a mysterious \"foul odor\" when he blew his nose turned out to have a BB gun pellet lodged in his nose, which had been there for about eight years, according to a new report. The teen first visited doctors for his symptoms when he was 15 years old. He said he had experienced congestion for several years along with a reduced sense of smell, according to the report, published Feb. 18 in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery. Doctors examined the inside of the teen\\'s nose with an endoscope, or a flexible tube with a camera at the end; and saw that he had so-called \"turbinate hypertrophy,\" or an enlargement of narrow passageways called turbinates in the nose. This condition can sometimes be caused by seasonal allergies or sinus inflammation, according to Healthline. Doctors prescribed the teen a nasal spray and antihistamine medication, and told him to come back in four to six weeks. But the teen did not return until one year later, when he was 16, and he was still experiencing nasal symptoms. But now, when he blew his nose, \"a pungent, foul odor filled the room,\" the authors said. \"The patient reported that he did not feel he had bad breath, but he was embarrassed that every time he blew his nose there was a foul odor,\" they wrote. Related: 27 oddest medical cases  Doctors then performed a CT scan and saw there was 9-mm spherical structure in his nasal cavity, which looked like a foreign body. The teen underwent surgery to remove the object, which turned out to be a metallic BB pellet. A talk with the teen\\'s family revealed that he had been shot in the nose with a pellet gun when he was about 8 or 9 years old, the report said. At the time, the boy hadn\\'t experienced symptoms, and so his parents had not sought medical care. Foreign objects lodged in the nose can sometimes cause a foul odor because \"the foreign body causes blockage of natural drainage pathways in the nose, so there is a buildup of mucus, inhaled debris and bacteria,\" study co-author Dylan Z. Erwin, a medical student at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, told Live Science. But this buildup doesn\\'t always trigger a fever or other signs of a whole-body infection, and so the diagnosis can be missed, Erwin said. In addition, the pellet in the boy\\'s case was even harder to spot because over time, it had become covered with new tissue. \"Healthy-appearing tissue had completely grown over it,\" Erwin said. For doctors to even see the pellet, this surrounding tissue had to be surgically removed, he said. —11 weird things people have swallowed —What are the most common ways people get injured? —12 amazing images in medicine \"It had become lodged in the floor of the nose beneath a structure called the inferior turbinate. It was essentially so tightly wedged, that blowing the nose didn\\'t remove it and it was too far back to be easily seen,\" Erwin added. Pellet gun injuries are common in adolescents, but the current case was unique because the injury happened so long ago, and the boy did not have symptoms of nasal trauma, the report said. When a foreign body is stuck in the nose for a long period of time, doctors worry about a number of complications, including the development of an infection that spreads to the jaw or eyes; or the breakdown of nearby bone due to years of inflammation, Erwin said. In addition, there\\'s also a risk that the patient could inhale the object if it became dislodged from the nose and goes down the back of the throat, he said. Fortunately, the teen hadn\\'t experienced any of these complications. After his surgery, his nose tissue appeared normal, and the unpleasant odor disappeared, the report said.

       "  'Full Article': \" Here's the good news: SpaceX landed a giant Starship for the first time Wednesday (March 3), after reaching an altitude of 6.2 miles (10 kilometers). The bad news: It exploded 8 minutes later. After two similar tests ended with Starships SN8 and SN9 failing to slow down enough before landing and exploding on impact, SpaceX tried a new technique for the landing of SN10. All three rocket engines at the bottom of the 160-foot-tall (49 meters), 30-foot-wide (9 m) machine ignited as the rocket righted itself before landing; the rocket also was able to slow down enough to make a soft landing. On SpaceX's YouTube feed, John Insprucker, the company's principal integration engineer, declared the landing a success and closed the stream. He emphasized, as SpaceX often does, that the success of the test is determined by data collected, not a perfect landing. It was Starship's most impressive achievement to date, and immediately demonstrated how far the project — intended to one day reach the moon and Mars — has come even in the last few months of work in Boca Chica, Texas. But as the dust cleared, it became clear that SN10 had crunched a bit on impact, sitting on the pad with a pronounced, awkward lean. A fire broke out at the base, and video streams from both NASA Spaceflight and Lab Padre showed a robotic fire extinguisher unsuccessfully battling the flames. Eight minutes after touchdown, about 14 minutes and 45 seconds after takeoff, there was a powerful explosion somewhere inside the rocket, which uses combustible methane as propellant. The heavy metal structure was hurled into the air a second time by the blast. And just when we thought the fun was over, SN10 took to the skies for a second time today! 😂 Great view from @LabPadre. pic.twitter.com/amX4nR91X5March 3, 2021 As of this writing, it's still not clear precisely what caused the explosion.

After a brief evaluation, the company said at 3:30 p.m. ET that it would make another attempt to launch SN10 about two hours later. SpaceX appears ready to test its tenth Starship prototype Wednesday (March 3), despite at least one problem in the run-up to launch. The test of the rocket named SN10 should see the vehicle loft to an altitude of 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) over Boca Chica, Texas before attempting an upright landing.

       "  'Title': 'Why type A blood may increase COVID-19 risk',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may latch more easily onto the airway cells of people with type A blood compared with those with type B or O blood, a new study suggests. The findings hint at a possible explanation for why, throughout the pandemic, studies have found those with type A blood are likelier to catch COVID-19 and develop severe symptoms than other blood types. Laboratory experiments revealed that part of the coronavirus called the \"receptor binding domain\" (RBD), which directly binds to cells to jumpstart infection, also grabs onto unique molecules associated with type A blood. These molecules, known as antigens, show up on cells that line the respiratory tract, including the lungs, according to the study, published March 3 in the journal Blood Advances. In theory, binding to these structures may help the coronavirus enter and infect the airway cells more easily — however, we don\\'t know that for sure yet, the study authors told Live Science. Related: 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history \"Does this really influence the ability of the virus to get into cells? Does it just influence its ability to adhere to the cells?\" said study author Dr. Sean Stowell, a transfusion medicine physician-scientist with appointments at Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital in Massachusetts and Emory University in Georgia. \"That\\'s open-ended. We\\'re working on that right now, but the jury is still out.\" In other words, the data provide the first physical link between the coronavirus and type A blood, but more research is needed to confirm that this difference affects the odds of actual infection. Since the early days of the pandemic, several studies of coronavirus patients have uncovered trends in what blood types seem to become infected most often, Live Science previously reported. \"Many studies have found associations between blood groups and propensity for SARS-CoV-2 infections,\" in particular, showing that people with type O blood have a lower risk of catching COVID-19, compared with non-O blood types, said Dr. Torben Barington, a clinical immunologist at Odense University Hospital and the University of Southern Denmark, who was not involved in the study. People with type A blood may also be more likely to develop severe symptoms and respiratory failure when they do contract the virus, some studies found. \"Several hypotheses have been proposed for these associations, but we still need to learn what the mechanisms actually are,\" Barington told Live Science in an email. This new study hints at a possible explanation for why SARS-CoV-2 may infect blood type A individuals more easily than type O — though it doesn\\'t explain why type B is also linked to more infections than type O, he noted. Stowell said that he and his colleagues were curious about the link between blood type and COVID-19, but that they actually struck inspiration for their new study while developing a diagnostic test for the disease. While creating the test, \"we started looking at different parts of the virus and realized that the receptor binding domain … it looks very similar to an ancient group of proteins called galectins,\" Stowell said. Galectins can be found in all multicellular animals and bind to carbohydrates, or sugar structures, known as glycans; in humans, galectins can be found all over the body and participate in many processes, from muscle development to metabolism to immune cell behavior, Stowell said. In the past, \"we\\'ve observed that galectins really love to bind to blood group antigens,\" proteins and molecules that are specific to different blood groups and stick off the surface of cells. Blood group antigens come in two flavors — A and B — and the presence or absence of these antigens determine a person\\'s blood group — A, B, AB, which has both, or O, which has neither, according to the American Red Cross. The antigens are found not only on blood cells in the body, but also on other tissues, including the lining of the lungs. Given the molecular similarity between the coronavirus RBD and galectins, \"we thought, \\'Well, maybe the virus directly binds to blood group antigens,\\'\" Stowell said. If that were the case, blood group antigens may somehow influence the likelihood of the infection taking hold, he said. For example, some viruses accrue on cells by first grabbing hold of glycans on their surfaces, according to a 2016 report in the journal Current Opinion in Structural Biology; the viruses then let go of these glycans to slip through nearby entryways into the cell, triggering infection. Something similar could potentially be happening with blood group antigens and SARS-CoV-2, the authors thought. With this hypothesis in hand, the team headed to the lab to run experiments. The team analyzed how the RBD interacted with red blood cells isolated from blood group A, B and O individuals; they also ran experiments with synthetic blood group antigens, based on antigens found on both respiratory and red blood cells from the three blood groups. This allowed the team to compare whether and how the RBD binds with blood group antigens on blood cells and in the respiratory tracts. \"The flavor of blood group antigens that are expressed on the surface of red blood cells are slightly different than the flavor that lines our lungs,\" Stowell noted. Specifically, due to their differing molecular structures, the antigens bind a little differently to respiratory cells than they do to blood cells, he said. What\\'s interesting is that this subtle difference seems to matter to the RBD of the coronavirus, he said. Based on the experiments, the RBD doesn\\'t readily bind to any of the red blood cell antigens and shows no preference between the blood types, in this regard. In contrast, the RBD \"exhibited high preference\" for the type A antigens found on respiratory cells. \"It was clear; there was this preference. We didn\\'t expect that,\" Stowell said. Now, \"whether that actually means that the virus is more likely to infect blood group A, I\\'d say, we don\\'t know.\" Given that these data were drawn from lab experiments, the result may not perfectly reflect what happens in the human body, said Fumiichiro Yamamoto, an immunohematologist at the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona, who was not involved in the study. —11 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across species —14 coronavirus myths busted by science —The 12 deadliest viruses on Earth \"The binding may or may not reflect the actual situation on the cell surface,\" especially since the density of antigens on the cell surface may differ from scenarios tested in the lab experiments, Yamamoto told Live Science in an email. Additionally, in the body, other substances compete to bind to the same blood group antigens, so it\\'s unclear how many coronavirus particles would ultimately latch on, he added. What\\'s more, the type A antigens found on the surface of airway cells can also be secreted elsewhere in the body, such as in the saliva, he said. That means the virus could potentially bind to these free-floating antigens, as well, decreasing the number of viral particles that reach the respiratory cells, he said. And in addition to unique antigens, different blood types also carry specific blood group antibodies, molecules that help the immune system eliminate foreign invaders, Barington said. These antibodies are particularly \"prevalent in blood group O individuals and have been proposed to neutralize virus on our mucosal surfaces,\" he said. It may be that both blood group antigens and antibodies influence the likelihood of COVID-19 infection, and their individual contributions will need to be sorted out, he said. In regards to the new study, \"it\\'s an important first step,\" Stowell said. \"The critical thing to do [now] is to determine whether the actual virus, in terms of its ability to infect cells, is influenced by blood group antigens or not.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': \"Decapitated Stone Age woman's head rolled into a cave in Italy\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Following her death about 5,600 years ago, a Stone Age woman\\'s skull took an unexpected journey when mud and water washed it away from her burial site and into the craggy rocks of a steep cave in what is now Italy, a new study finds. When archaeologists found the skull, its resting spot in the cave shaft was so hard to reach that only one archaeologist, using rock climbing equipment, could squeeze into the space to recover it. During a later analysis, the researchers found that the skull was very scratched up; at first, they couldn\\'t make heads or tails of what had happened to the ancient woman. But, after determining which of the skull\\'s lesions were likely caused by humans and which were likely incurred as the skull tumbled against various rocks, the researchers came up with a possible scenario. Once this woman died, people in her community likely dismembered her corpse — a funeral practice performed at other burials from this time period and region. After people separated the woman\\'s skull from the rest of her body, environmental forces swept it away into the cave, the researchers suggested. Related: Back to the Stone Age: 17 key milestones in Paleolithic life Archaeologists discovered the lone skull in 2015 in northern Italy\\'s Marcel Loubens cave. Caves are common sites for ancient burials, but archaeologists couldn\\'t find any other human remains there, even when they returned in 2017 with climbing equipment to retrieve the skull. A CT (computed tomography) scan and analysis of the skull itself revealed that the woman was between the ages of 24 and 35 when she died, while radiocarbon dating indicated that she lived between 3630 and 3380 B.C., during the New Stone Age, or Neolithic period. To put that into perspective, this woman lived just before Ötzi the Iceman, whose mummified remains date to 3300 B.C. and were also found in northern Italy. Several traumatic lesions on the woman\\'s skull helped the researchers piece together her strange story. One dent — which showed signs of healing, meaning it was incurred when she was alive — may have been made forcefully with tools, as there were parallel grooves below it, the researchers said. Perhaps this woman had undergone cranial surgery, such as trepanation — a technique employed during the Neolithic and later in which holes are made in the skull, they said. A smudge of red ocher pigment found on this dent may have been placed there for therapeutic or symbolic reasons, the team noted. Other lesions indicated that the soft tissues on her skull had been cut and scraped off after she died, as these lesions showed no signs of healing, the researchers said. This practice has been documented at other Neolithic burials in Italy; for instance, at Re Tiberio Cave in northern Italy, the long arm and leg bones of up to 17 Neolithic human skeletons were arranged in order, and their heads were missing — clues that these people\\'s body parts might have been separated and rearranged after death. Other Neolithic remains found at nearby caves also show evidence of cranial scrape marks that were made after those people died, the researchers said.  Life during the Neolithic was challenging, so it\\'s no surprise that the woman wasn\\'t in the best health. Tiny holes on top of her skull may be related to inflammation, possibly from chronic anemia (iron or vitamin B12 deficiency), the researchers said. The woman also had two dense, ivory-like spots on her skull, which were likely benign tumors. Even her tooth enamel was underdeveloped, suggesting that she had health problems when her permanent teeth were developing in early childhood. She also had several cavities, possibly due to a diet high in carbohydrates, the researchers said. Related: Images: A new face for Ötzi the Iceman mummy Other damage and encrusted sediment on the woman\\'s skull told another story — essentially, that natural forces moved the woman\\'s cranium after her burial. After the woman was laid to rest, the dismembered skull rolled away, probably with water and mud that was flowing downhill toward a sinkhole. \"After a long and bumpy ride, [the skull] accidentally ended up in the cave,\" the researchers said in a statement. Over time, the sinkhole\\'s geological activity created a cave, where the skull sat for 5,600 years until it was discovered by modern archaeologists. The skull\\'s resting spot is \"unusual,\" but \"the authors are able to provide a plausible scenario how the skull ended up in this cave,\" said Thomas Terberger, an archaeologist at the Lower Saxony State Office for Cultural Heritage, in Hannover, Germany, who wasn\\'t involved in the study. But the origin of some of the skull\\'s lesions is still murky, he said. —In photos: Intricately carved stone balls puzzle archaeologists —Photos: Stone Age skulls found on wooden stakes —In images: Deformed skulls and Stone Age tombs from France \"I have the feeling the authors themselves, who did a very good job, are not 100% sure about this,\" Terberger told Live Science in an email. \"It is not always easy to distinguish between striations (caused by transport in the sediment/rocky ground) and cut marks.\" Even though this skull represents just one individual, \"case studies like this are important to show the huge variety of postmortem episodes that can actually happen to skeletal remains, initiated by natural or anthropogenic [human-caused] factors,\" Christian Meyer, lead researcher at the OsteoArchaeological Research Center in Germany, who wasn\\'t involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.

       "  'Title': \"Could a nuclear reactor help solve the mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance?\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Researchers at Penn State are subjecting an old, worn sheet of aluminum to a particle beam from the heart of a nuclear reactor in the hopes of cracking the mystery of Amelia Earhart\\'s disappearance. Celebrated as the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, Earhart is also at the center of one of the most well-known historical mysteries, one that has riveted enthusiasts since that fateful day in 1937 when her Lockheed Electra 10E vanished from all radar. On July 2 of that year, Earhart, along with her navigator Fred Noonan, took off from Papua New Guinea during an attempt to circumnavigate the world. But the pair never landed at their destination, Howland Island in the central Pacific Ocean. During the flight, Earhart made contact with the Coast Guard ship Itasca, apparently experiencing radio and instrument trouble and unsure of her precise location. Earhart, Noonan and her Electra were never found. In 1991, Earhart enthusiast Richard Gillespie found an aluminum panel in washed-up storm debris on the Pacific island of Nikumaroro, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) from Howland. Gillespie has said he suspects the panel may have come from Earhart\\'s plane, and now a Penn State team is using a neutron beam to — they hope — uncover hidden clues that might support that hypothesis. (Gillespie is the executive director of The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, or TIGHAR, which in 1988 launched a project to solve Earhart\\'s disappearance.) \"Initially, I was a little skeptical,\" Kenan Ünlü, a nuclear engineering professor at Penn State, said in a statement. \"We\\'ve had inquiries about these kinds of things before, but we had an extensive call with [Gillespie], who was clear that they\\'re interested in whatever data we might be able to provide, even if it proves that the patch couldn\\'t possibly belong to Amelia Earhart\\'s plane. We agreed to see what we could see.\" Related: The incredible life and times of Amelia Earhart The researchers hope that a technique called neutron radiography might reveal otherwise invisible clues as to the aluminum\\'s origin. Researchers have already determined that it was hacked at with an ax along its edges, except for one side that was \"repeatedly flexed\" to snap it off of its source. Firing neutron beams from the campus\\'s Breazeale Nuclear Reactor should reveal any features of the panel that are made from something other than uniform aluminum, the researchers said. If the metal were just plain aluminum, the neutrons would pass through cleanly. But any carbon- or hydrogen-containing molecules on the surface — perhaps bits of coral that had filled in a serial number etched into the metal, for instance — would scatter the neutrons. And the pattern of scattered neutrons would form an image of the coral (or other material) in the same way an X-ray image reveals the bones inside your arm.  Welsey Frey is the director of the McClellan Nuclear Research Center (MNRC) at the University of California, Davis, another site that uses a nuclear reactor for the same types of advanced neutron imaging. He and his team are not involved in the Penn State project. He said it\\'s likely the Penn State analysis will turn up interesting features of the aluminum sheet that might help tie it to Earhart\\'s plane or disprove the connection. But it\\'s unlikely that they\\'d find definitive proof that the aluminum came from that particular airframe. \"Will they get information on what era that metal was produced in? Yes, they most likely will. Will they be able to tie it to Amelia Earhart\\'s plane? Probably not.\" Neutron radiography is similar to X-ray imaging, he said. X-rays pass through the soft tissues of the body but bounce off the harder tissues or bones, which are on average made of heavier atoms that tend to block X-ray light. Neutrons similarly pass easily through certain materials, such as aluminum, but they tend to bounce off of materials containing hydrogen and carbon. If the researchers were lucky enough to get their hands on an aluminum sheet from Earhart\\'s plane with a serial number hidden under organic matter like coral — and if that serial number was on a list confirmed to belong to her plane — then neutron radiography might definitively prove the aluminum\\'s origin. It would also have the advantage of not damaging the object, unlike other means of finding such a serial number. But that would take a lot of luck, Frey said. The Penn State researchers also plan to use a related technique, known as neutron activation analysis, to precisely identify the chemical makeup of the material, according to Ünlü. \"This approach can determine the ingredients of a material at parts-per-million or parts-per-billion level sensitivity,\" he said. —In photos: Searching for Amelia Earhart —10 biggest historical mysteries that will probably never be solved —Image gallery: Stunning shots of the Titanic shipwreck Frey said that\\'s much more promising. Different alloys were used for different purposes at different points in history. If the aluminum turned out to use an alloy that wasn\\'t developed until World War II, for instance, then it can\\'t be Earhart\\'s. But if it matches the alloys used to build aircraft in Earhart\\'s era, that would bolster the case linking it to her plane. (Frey said he\\'s used the same technique to see if a horseshoe found in his backyard may have come from a Vaquero — one of the Spanish-speaking cowboys who are rumored to have watered their cows in a pond near his house — in the 19th century. His analysis of the steel showed it came from before WWII, which supported the theory. But that didn\\'t prove the connection.) The results of the Penn State analysis won\\'t be public until later this year, the researchers said. They did tease that they had uncovered new information, but said they need to refine their approach for imaging this object before they are certain. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

Human-induced climate change is largely to blame. This \"unprecedented\" slowdown could impact weather patterns and sea levels on both sides of the Atlantic, the researchers found. And it only looks poised to worsen over the coming decades if climate change continues unabated. Indeed, if global warming persists at its current pace, the Gulf Stream could pass a critical \"tipping point\" by the year 2100, lead study author Levke Caesar, a climatologist at Maynooth University in Ireland, said, potentially causing the current to grind to a halt, regardless of the climate. This disruption could unleash rising sea levels along the coasts of North America and northwestern Europe, and usher in more extreme weather such as heat waves and cyclones. \"If the Gulf Stream crosses its tipping point, it will continue to weaken even if we have managed to stop global warming,\" Caesar told Live Science. \"Afterwards, it will slow down by a lot, coming close to a complete shutdown of the circulation.\" Related: 10 Steamy signs that climate change is speeding up The Gulf Stream (also known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC) is essentially a \"giant conveyor belt\" along the East coast of the United States, study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany, said in a statement.

By the time it reaches the North Atlantic, that warm surface water becomes cooler, saltier and denser, sinking into the deep sea before being driven south again, where the cycle repeats. According to Rahmstorf, the current moves more than 5.2 billion gallons (20 million cubic meters) of water per second, or \"almost 100 times the Amazon [River] flow.\"  This wet conveyor belt has myriad climate impacts on both sides of the Atlantic, keeping temperatures in Florida and the U.K. mild, influencing the path and strength of cyclones and helping to regulate sea levels. Since direct measurements began in 2004, however, scientists have detected a troubling pattern: AMOC currents are getting slower and weaker. To better contextualize this slowdown in their new study — published Feb. 25 in the journal Nature Geoscience — the researchers attempted to extend the history of the AMOC\\'s flow by nearly 2,000 years. Because no direct measurements of the flow are available before the last two decades, the team turned to proxy data: information from environmental archives, such as tree rings and ice cores, that can help put the AMOC in a long-term perspective. The team used 11 different proxies — including temperature records, Atlantic silt data, underwater sediment cores and deep-sea coral population records — to create a comprehensive picture of how warm the AMOC was and how fast it was moving over the past 1,600 years. \"We looked for example at the size of the grains in ocean sediment cores, as a faster current can transport larger grains,\" Caesar said. \"We also looked at the species compositions of corals, because different types of corals prefer different water temperatures, and the Gulf Stream system influences water temperatures in the North Atlantic.\" Together, these proxies told a unified story about the current\\'s sudden decline, beginning with a small slowdown in about 1850, at the end of the Little Ice Age (a period of global cooling that spanned from roughly 1300 to 1850). A second, more dramatic slowdown began in the mid-20th century; since then, currents have weakened by an additional 15%, the team found. \"We found consistent evidence that the system over the last decades has been weaker than any time before in the last 1,600 years,\" Caesar said. This slowdown is a predictable effect of climate change, the researchers wrote. Global warming increases annual rainfall and accelerates the melting of ice sheets, including the Greenland Ice Sheet in the North Atlantic. Both of these factors dump ever greater amounts of freshwater into the ocean, reducing the density and salinity of the surface water at the northern end of the Gulf Stream conveyor belt. According to the researchers, this freshwater inhibits how quickly the water can sink and begin its journey back south, weakening the overall flow of the AMOC. The team concluded that, at the current rate of climate change, the Gulf Stream\\'s flow could weaken by an additional 45% by the year 2100, plunging the current close to a critical tipping point. If the flow continues to weaken (or collapse entirely), the effects could be severe.

Other studies have linked severe heat waves and storm patterns in northern Europe and the eastern United States to the weakened current. The precise impacts could be \"even more severe,\" Caesar said, though scientists won\\'t know for sure until we cross that bridge. Hopefully, by limiting global warming as much as possible in the coming decades, we\\'ll never have to find out. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': \"Woman's foul-smelling 'turkey ear' caused by decades-long infection\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'A woman in her 50s was diagnosed with a case of \"turkey ear,\" in which a tuberculosis infection of the skin caused her right ear to progressively swell over many years until it reached an enormous size. The term turkey ear specifically refers to an infection of the earlobe that causes the skin to turn reddish, bumpy and hard to the touch; the comparison to turkeys may be a reference to the birds\\' fleshy, bumpy necks, but the case reports don\\'t specify which feature inspired the name. In the woman\\'s case, the infection started in childhood and slowly progressed over time, turning the swollen ear a reddish-brown color, according to a report of the case published March 3 in the journal JAMA Dermatology. An examination, conducted at a medical center in Israel, also revealed that regions of the woman\\'s ear had taken on an \"apple jelly appearance,\" literally meaning that the color resembled that of a jelly made from cooked apples, the authors wrote. The term \"apple jelly\" also refers to the texture of the raised nodules of infected skin, which feel gelatinous when touched, according to a 2013 report in the journal Infectious Diseases in Clinical Practice. \"She was adamant that the lesion had been present since early childhood but had gradually increased\" and had begun to leak a foul-smelling discharge, the authors wrote. Related: 27 oddest medical cases The woman originally went to the clinic in 2008 and received two months of treatment with four antibiotic medications for the turkey ear; the treatment was then cut back to two medications for the following seven months. The infection had been improving with treatment, but she did not follow up until 2020, when doctors had a chance to reexamine her, the authors wrote. Her infection had completely resolved, and the ear had shrunk back to a normal size. Only a patch of scarred skin remained as a mark of the infection. Tuberculosis infections of the skin are caused by the same bacterium that infects the lungs, known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, according to the case report. It\\'s relatively rare for the bacterium to infect the skin, though, as compared with other infection sites outside the lungs, such as the lymph nodes, according to a 2012 report in the Indian Journal of Dermatology. Specifically, the woman with turkey ear was diagnosed with \"lupus vulgaris,\" a condition in which the M. tuberculosis infection progresses very slowly in the skin, changing its color and texture over the course of several years. This is the most common manifestation of tuberculosis infection in the skin. The infection usually occurs when M. tuberculosis migrates to the skin from elsewhere in the body, often via the blood or lymphatic system. Very, very rarely, the condition can set in after a person receives the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, intended to prevent tuberculosis, the authors noted. This unusual complication is estimated to occur in only 5 out of every 1 million of these vaccinations, according to a 2016 report in the journal Case Reports in Dermatology. —11 weird things people have swallowed —The 10 weirdest medical cases in the animal kingdom —12 amazing images in medicine The BCG vaccine is not widely used in the United States, where control measures have effectively reduced the risk of infection, but the vaccine is still commonly given to infants and children in countries where the condition remains common, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Infection (CDC). \"The chronic, relatively asymptomatic nature of [lupus vulgaris] may cause a significant delay in diagnosis,\" the authors noted. In fact, the authors found several other case reports describing patients who had lupus vulgaris for decades before being diagnosed. In general, tuberculosis of the skin has \"become rare in past decades,\" but the disease could still crop up in unexpected places as people emigrate from regions where tuberculosis is endemic, the authors wrote. Therefore, dermatologists worldwide should still consider lupus vulgaris as a possibility if they encounter patients with turkey ears or apple jelly nodules, they wrote.

       "  'Title': \"Microdosing with 'shrooms or LSD no better than placebo, study finds\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': ' People who microdose, or take tiny doses of psychedelic drugs, swear that the practice boosts their mood, focus and productivity without causing a \"trip.\" But a new study finds that these perceived benefits may be due to the placebo effect. The study, which involved nearly 200 participants, is one of the largest \"placebo-controlled\" studies on psychedelics ever conducted, in which people take either a real microdose of psychedelics or a placebo — i.e. a \"dummy pill.\" The study had a unique design in which participants were \"self-blinded,\" meaning they followed instructions at home to mix up their microdose pills with placebo pills, so they didn\\'t know which they were taking. The researchers found that participants who microdosed — usually with LSD — for about a month did indeed experience psychological benefits, including boosts in well-being and life satisfaction. However, those in the placebo group experienced similar improvements, and there was no statistically meaningful difference between the two groups, the researchers said. The findings \"suggest that these improvements are not due to the pharmacological action of microdosing, but are rather explained by the placebo effect,\" or the expectation that a particular drug or treatment will work, the authors wrote in their study, published Tuesday (March 2) in the journal eLife. Related: Trippy tales: The history of 8 hallucinogens The results don\\'t mean that people who microdose aren\\'t getting any benefits. \"Our results are mixed: On the one hand, we observed microdosing\\'s benefits in a wide range of psychological measures; on the other hand, equal benefits were seen among participants taking placebos,\" study lead author Balázs Szigeti, a research associate at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom, said in a statement. \"Many participants who reported that they experienced positive effects while taking the placebo were shocked to learn after the study that they hadn\\'t been taking the real drug.\" The authors caution that their self-blinded study wasn\\'t as rigorous as a true randomized controlled clinical trial. For one, participants were eligible for the study only if they were already microdosing, and they sourced their own drugs from the black market; so the researchers could not verify the purity or the dosage of the LSD participants were using. But the authors say their study design more accurately reflects how microdosing is done in \"real-world\" settings, compared with studies conducted in a laboratory. Microdosing became trendy in Silicon Valley about five years ago, and soon became more popular around the world. But much of the support for the benefits of microdosing comes from anecdotal reports, and there are few rigorous scientific studies of the practice — most of the studies that have been conducted lack a control group, or group of people who don\\'t take microdoses. In the new study, the researchers recruited 191 microdosers for their online study. About three-quarters of the participants reported microdosing with LSD or a similar (analog) drug; and about 25% reported microdosing with psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in \"magic mushrooms.\" Participants then underwent the self-blinding process: They placed their real microdoses into pill capsules, and also made a set of placebos, which were just pill capsules with nothing inside. Then, they placed capsules into envelopes with QR codes for tracking by the researchers, and shuffled the envelopes. By the end of the process, the participants didn\\'t know which pills they were taking. One-third of participants took only placebo capsules for four weeks; one-third took only real microdoses; and one-third took \"half and half,\" meaning they took placebo pills for a total of two weeks and real microdoses for a total of two weeks (alternating between a week of placebo pills and a week of microdoses). The participants also completed online surveys to assess their mental health and cognition. Soon after taking the real microdoses, participants reported improvements in mood, creativity and anxiety. But participants who took a placebo — but thought they were taking a microdose — also reported similar benefits, meaning that the actual content of the capsules didn\\'t matter for their effects; rather, participants\\' beliefs did, the authors said. What\\'s more, neither the microdose nor the placebo group saw improvements in the results of their cognitive tests during the study. It\\'s important to note that many of the participants correctly guessed whether they were taking a microdose or a placebo, largely because they were familiar with subtle sensations from the drugs such as muscle tingling and stomach stress; but the study researchers did take these guesses into account in their analysis. —How psychedelic drugs create such weird hallucinations —A single psychedelic drug trip can change your personality for years —9 weird ways you can test positive for drugs \"It certainly appears so far that at least a significant portion of the claimed benefits of microdosing are the result of placebo effects,\" Matthew Johnson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"This should be no surprise, because the placebo effect is nearly always at play in the real world use of a medication.\" Still, Johnson added that \"the big remaining question for me is whether all of the claimed benefits are the result of a placebo effect,\" or whether there are some direct beneficial effects from the drug microdoses in addition to the placebo effect. \"My best guess is that there is indeed some direct efficacy for at least some measures and in some circumstances and some individuals, but we need more research to further tease out placebo from any direct efficacy,\" Johnson said. The authors note that the study participants were generally healthy, and it\\'s unclear if the finding would differ in a population that had been recently diagnosed with a mental health condition.

       "  'Title': 'Ancient papyrus holds the world’s oldest guide to mummification',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'The oldest known instructions for the ancient art of embalming mummies were recently discovered on a medical papyrus from ancient Egypt. How-to descriptions of the mummification process are exceptionally rare in the archaeological record — only two other such \"manuals\" are known. This newest example, found in an ancient scroll dating to around 1450 B.C., predates other mummification texts by more than 1,000 years. The guide contains many helpful suggestions, such as how to make herbal insect repellent and using red linen wrappings to reduce facial swelling. Sofie Schiødt, a research assistant in the Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies at the University of Copenhagen, discovered the embalming manual while translating a papyrus for her doctoral thesis, which will be published in 2022, university representatives said in a statement. Related: Image gallery: Mummy evisceration techniques Half of the papyrus scroll is in the university\\'s Papyrus Carlsberg Collection, and the other half is in the Louvre Museum in Paris. Prior to that, each piece was privately owned, and they were acquired by the university and the Louvre\\xa0in 2015 and 2006, respectively, Schiødt told Live Science in an email. It wasn\\'t until 2018 that experts learned that the two pieces were part of the same scroll. In its entirety, the papyrus measures nearly 20 feet (6 meters) long and is inscribed on both sides. It is the second-longest medical papyrus from ancient Egypt, and Schiødt\\'s translation project relies mostly on high-resolution photographs of the precious artifact. \"This way we can move displaced fragments around digitally, as well as enhance colors to better read passages where the ink is not so well-preserved,\" Schiødt said. \"It also aids in reading difficult signs when you can zoom in on the high-res photos.\"  There are five sections in the medical papyrus. In the first are short medical recipes, followed by a section on herbs. Next is a long section on skin diseases, followed by the embalming manual, \"and finally another section of succinct medical recipes,\" Schiødt said. Only a small portion of the papyrus — just three columns of text — covers embalming. Though the mummification section is brief, it\\'s packed with details, many of which were absent from later embalming texts. \"Several recipes are included in the manual describing the manufacturing of various aromatic unguents,\" Schiødt told Live Science, referring to substances used as ointments. However, some parts of the embalming process, such as drying the corpse with natron — a desiccating compound made of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate (salt and baking soda) — aren\\'t described at length. \"As such, the text reads mostly as a memory aid, helping the embalmer remember the most intricate parts of the embalming process,\" she said. – Myth or truth? 7 ancient health ideas explained – Photos: The amazing mummies of Peru and Egypt – 10 of the most mysterious ancient manuscripts According to the manual, embalming a person took 70 days, and the task was performed in a special workshop near the person\\'s grave. The two main stages — drying and wrapping — each lasted 35 days. Schiødt said that one of the exciting new pieces of information from the text involves a procedure for embalming a dead person\\'s face. The instructions include a recipe that combines plant-based aromatics and binders, cooking them into a liquid \"with which the embalmers coat a piece of red linen,\" she said. \"The red linen is then applied to the dead person\\'s face in order to encase it in a protective cocoon of fragrant and anti-bacterial matter,\" and this was repeated every four days, according to the study. On days when the embalmers were not actively treating the body, they covered it with straw infused with aromatic oils \"in order to keep insects and scavengers away,\" according to Schiødt. Work on the mummy typically wrapped up by day 68, \"after which the final days were spent on ritual activities allowing the deceased to live on in the afterlife,\" Schiødt wrote.

       "  'Title': \"Human ancestor 'Lucy' gets a new face in stunning reconstruction\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'New facial reconstructions of two early humans, famously known as Lucy and the Taung child, show how these two individuals may have looked when they lived in Africa millions of years ago. And unlike past reconstructions, which may have relied on opaque, arbitrary or even racist ideas to reconstruct the faces of our ancient relatives, the authors of the new reconstructions lay out their process transparently. For the reconstructions, of Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis), the oldest and most complete human ancestor when researchers discovered her 3.2 million-year-old remains in 1974, and the 2.8 million-year-old Taung child (Australopithecus africanus), who died at age 3 in what is now South Africa, researchers used pigmented silicone casts, with Lucy\\'s skin tone similar to that of a bonobo (Pan paniscus), while the Taung child\\'s features were more similar to modern humans native to South Africa, researchers wrote in a blog post. These casts show just how complex reconstructions of early humans are. Other reconstructions of Lucy, the Taung child and other early humans were made by artists who made assumptions that aren\\'t testable with current science, including whether these ancient species looked more like apes or modern humans, and how their soft tissues, including their muscles and the thickness of their skin, appeared. These reconstructions are often found in natural history museums and are meant to educate the public about human evolution. Related: \\xa0Photos: See the ancient faces of a man-bun wearing bloke and a Neanderthal woman In a new review on reconstructions of early humans, published Feb. 26 in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, the researchers, who also wrote the blog post, found that many reconstructions \"have been largely unchallenged by the scientific community and displayed in museums with very little empirical evidence to support them,\" they wrote in the blog post. When they looked at depictions around the world, they found that every museum\\'s version of Lucy looked very different, review lead researcher Ryan Campbell, a doctoral student in the Department of Anatomy & Pathology at the University of Adelaide in Australia, wrote in the blog. \"I expected to find consistency in those reconstructions displayed in natural history museums, but the differences, even there, were so severe that I almost thought all previous practitioners had never encountered a single hominid reconstruction before commencing their own.\" A previous analysis of reconstructions of 860 hominins (a group including humans, monkeys and their extinct close relatives) from 55 museum displays showed remarkable inconsistencies, even those depicting the same individuals. That research, part of a thesis published in 2012, was the first to show such discrepancies, Campbell and his colleagues wrote in their review paper. So, what\\'s to be done? First, artists, scientists and museums may want to acknowledge that reconstruction is currently more art than science. According to review co-researcher Gabriel Vinas, a sculptural artist at Arizona State University, \"methods for achieving scientifically justified reconstructions are still not quite in our grasp, despite what many artists and institutions readily advertise,\" he wrote in the blog. Another problem is that some reconstructions, including 2D ones, and their exhibits are racist or inaccurate, the researchers said. \"Actually, many of the previous reconstructions have been highly influenced by imaginary tales about what is \\'primitive\\' and \\'savage,\\' versus what is \\'civilized and \\'modern,\\'\" review senior researcher Rui Diogo, an assistant professor of anatomy at Howard University in Washington, D.C., wrote in the blog. For example, the iconic 2D image of human evolution, Rudolph Zallinger\\'s \"The March of Progress,\" printed in a series of science books in 1965, perpetuates the incorrect idea that humans evolved in a linear progression from animal to ape to a European-looking white-skinned man, the researchers wrote in the review. Other inaccuracies found in drawings or exhibits show Lucy with a mate and children, even though the nuclear family structure is a recent construction in human history, Diogo said. —Photos: The reconstruction of teen who lived 9,000 years ago —Image gallery: The faces of Egyptian mummies revealed —Album: A new face for Ötzi the iceman mummy In reconstructing the faces of Lucy and the Taung child, the researchers tried their best to \"move away from intuition,\" and instead be scientifically accurate and transparent in their methods, they wrote in the review. For the Taung child, they used traditional molding and casting techniques to make a duplicate skull from another cast of the original specimen (commercially available casts weren\\'t as accurate, they said). The Taung child\\'s skull was well preserved, but they still had to make assumptions about how to design its facial tissues. Because soft tissues from early humans haven\\'t survived, artists have to decide whether to base muscles, skin and other soft tissue dimensions on data from primates like apes, chimpanzees or humans, or a mixture of species. For example, while reconstructing the Taung child, the team created two reconstructions — one more apelike and the other more humanlike to show the difference between the two interpretations. Other practitioners should clearly communicate their techniques, too, the researchers said.  Lucy\\'s reconstruction, meanwhile, was a challenge. Even though she\\'s the most reconstructed early human ancestor, Lucy \"is a poor candidate for the facial reconstruction procedure because most of Lucy’s cranial bones are missing,\" the researchers wrote in the study. But her lower jawbone is fairly complete, so that helped the artists recreate her head. For Lucy, the team used data on modern humans skin thickness, and plugged them into equations designed to determine early human skin thickness. But even though the result may be perceived as better than Lucy reconstructions that relied on more intuitive approaches, \"we believe that this is not at all the case,\" the researchers wrote in the study. That\\'s because the equation they used sometimes gave negative results, which isn\\'t possible (an animal can\\'t have negative tissue thickness). \"Thus, these equations are perhaps only appropriate for reconstructing hominins\" that look more like modern humans, the researchers wrote in the study.  A reconstruction of a Neanderthal specimen, known as Amud 1, was easier, as Neanderthals — compared with Lucy’s group — had more facial similarities with modern humans. However, the team had to estimate, based on other datasets, how to situate other features, such as the Neanderthal\\'s nose profile and mouth width.   Going forward, scientists, artists and museums may want to remember that \"presenting information that is not known diminishes the value of that which is known, and may lead to confusion and discourage further interest in human evolutionary theory,\" the researchers wrote in the study.

       "  'Full Article': 'A massive fireball meteor briefly lit up the night sky above the U.K. on Sunday (Feb. 28) and was seen by a potentially record-breaking number of people. The fireball flared across the sky at 9:54 p.m. local time over southwest England for around six seconds. Witnesses said the meteor emitted an unusually bright light that was seen across the U.K. and as far away as Ireland and the Netherlands. Some people in close proximity to the fireball also reported hearing a sonic boom. Experts estimate the asteroid was traveling at around 30,000 mph (48,278 km/h) when it hit the atmosphere and started to burn up, according to a statement by the U.K. Fireball Alliance (UKFall). More than 800 people reported the meteor-sighting to the U.K. Meteor Observation Network — an amateur group of meteor watchers who contribute data to the International Meteor Organisation — and many also submitted videos captured by doorbell and security cameras. The sightings and footage might make it one of the most well-documented fireball meteors ever recorded on Earth, according to UKFall. Related: Crash! 10 biggest impact craters on Earth \"I first thought it was a bright star or plane, then it got bigger & faster, then a huge flash lit up the sky & it burst into a massive tail of orange sparks trailing behind like a giant firework,\" one witness wrote on Twitter. Due to its size and speed, the fireball may have left behind meteorites on the ground.  A fireball is another term for a very bright meteor, which has an apparent magnitude — the standardized measurement for the brightness of astronomical objects on a logarithmic scale — of minus 4 or below. Apparent magnitude is lower for brighter objects; for example, a full moon has a magnitude of minus12.6 and the sun is minus 26.7. Fireballs with a magnitude of minus 4 or below are brighter than Venus in the night sky, according to the American Meteor Society (AMS). Fireballs burns brightly thanks to the size and speed of the incoming object — most fireballs come from parent asteroids that are at least 3.3 feet (1 meter) across. As the asteroid hits our atmosphere, it slows down due to friction and heats up, releasing energy in the form of visible light. \"Most of the meteoroid vaporized during the six seconds of visible flight,\" Luke Daly, a UKFall scientist at the University of Glasgow, said in a statement. \"However, with this one we think quite a few fragments probably reached the ground.\" Several thousand fireball meteors burn through Earth\\'s atmosphere every day, according to the AMS. However, most burn up over the oceans and other uninhabited areas, or they streak through the sky during the day when people can\\'t see them. Only around 10 to 50 will reach the ground every day, and most will only end up as very small meteorites. \"Most are barely the size of a sugar cube,\" Sarah McMullan, a doctoral student at Imperial College London and part of UKFall, said in a statement. \"However, two or three are bigger, and that\\'s probably the case with this one.\" Using the videos submitted by members of the public and their own camera network, UKFall members calculated the trajectory of the fireball and predicted a likely impact zone north of Cheltenham for the asteroid fragments. So far, nobody in the area has reported finding the meteorites. From the meteor\\'s trajectory through the atmosphere, UKFall scientists have retraced the object\\'s journey through the solar system. \"The videos also allowed us to reconstruct its original orbit around the sun,\" Ashley King, a UKFall scientist at the Natural History Museum in London, said in the statement. \"This particular piece of asteroid spent most of its orbit between Mars and Jupiter, though sometimes got closer to the sun than Earth is.\" — The 7 strangest asteroids: Weird space rocks in our Solar System — Space-y tales: The 5 strangest meteorites — When space attacks: The 6 craziest meteor impacts The hunt is now on to collect the meteorites before they become contaminated by rain or exposure to the atmosphere. UKFall scientists have encouraged people to not break COVID-19 lockdown protocols to go searching for the space rocks, but have given some advice on what to do if they are found. \"If you do find a meteorite on the ground, ideally photograph it in place, note the location using your phone GPS, don\\'t touch it with a magnet, and, if you can, avoid touching it with your hands,\" Katherine Joy, a UKFall scientist at the University of Manchester, said in the statement. Hopefully, uncontaminated meteorites can be handed off to researchers, who can analyze their structure to help unravel mysteries surrounding the formation of our solar system.

       "  'Full Article': ' New radar images captured from space reveal a giant iceberg breaking off in Antarctica. The iceberg, called A-74, covers about 490 square miles (1,270 square kilometers), making it 1.5 times bigger than Greater Paris. It broke off from the northern region of Antarctica\\'s Brunt Ice Shelf on Feb. 26, just a few months after a large crack formed in November 2020. The new images of the iceberg\\'s big break were captured by the European Space Agency\\'s (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, an Earth-observing project made up of two orbiting satellites: Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B. \"Although the calving of the new berg was expected and forecasted some weeks ago, watching such remote events unfold is still captivating,\" ESA scientist Mark Drinkwater said in an ESA statement about the event and how incredible it is to watch it all happen from space. Photos: Diving beneath Antarctica\\'s Ross Ice Shelf  For years, glaciologists have monitored the cracks that have formed in the Brunt Ice Shelf, a large floating slab of ice 492 feet (150 meters) thick located on Antarctica\\'s northern rim and the site of the British Antarctic Survey\\'s (BAS) Halley Research Station. These scientists have been expecting a large \"calving event\" for at least a decade, according to the BAS. Ice calving, or iceberg or glacier calving, occurs when large pieces of ice break off of a glacier. The team working at the BAS Halley Research Station say that the station is unlikely to be affected by the recent calving event, according to the same BAS statement. The Brunt Ice Shelf, which typically flows west at about 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) per year, routinely experiences calving events. According to the BAS in the same statement, there is \"no evidence that climate change has played a significant role\" in this specific event. Photos: Behind the scenes of an Antarctic research base\\'s relocation In November 2020, a new chasm (or deep fissure) named the North Rift started quickly cutting across the ice shelf, moving about 16 feet (5 meters) per day, according to the same ESA statement. Finally, on Feb. 26, the crack spread apart, widening before the iceberg was completely free from the ice shelf. \"Over the following weeks and months, the iceberg could be entrained in the swift south-westerly flowing coastal current, run aground or cause further damage by bumping into the southern Brunt Ice Shelf. So we will be carefully monitoring the situation using data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission,\" Drinkwater added.

       "  'Title': \"Cuttlefish show self-control, pass 'marshmallow test'\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Cuttlefish can pass the \"marshmallow test\" — the famous psychological test of self-control. In this case, the cephalopods were willing to forgo meals when they knew that waiting meant they would be rewarded with more delicious treats, according to a new study. That makes them the first known invertebrates to show the ability to exert self-control. The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) — relatives of squids and octopuses — are sneaky hunters and impressive camouflagers, with the ability to quickly disappear into any environment. They are also scarily smart; studies previously showed that they have a good memory, can learn the value of different types of prey and can use past experience to help them predict where to find food. But prior to this study, it was unclear whether these creatures could also delay gratification. Related: Cuttlefish cuties: photos of color-changing cephalopods \"Self-control is thought to be the cornerstone of intelligence, as it is an important prerequisite for complex decision-making and planning for the future,\" said lead author Alex Schnell, a research associate in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge. Not all animals share this trait, and it was previously thought that the ones that do, such as great apes, corvids and parrots, have long and social lives. To see if a cephalopod should join the ranks, Schnell and her team adapted the famous \"marshmallow test\" so that it appealed to cuttlefish. In the 1960s, Walter Mischel led an experiment at Stanford University to test how much self-control children have when presented with a preferred treat such as a marshmallow (or other treats such as cookies and pretzels) and two options: either eat the one marshmallow now or wait for 15 to 20 minutes and get rewarded with two marshmallows. In the current study, Schnell\\'s team swapped out marshmallows for seafood munchies, after figuring out what six individual 9-month-old (not yet fully adult) cuttlefish preferred to eat. It turned out, all of them preferred live grass shrimp the most, followed by king prawn, with the Asian shore crab coming in last of the three. They then set up a two-chamber apparatus with transparent sliding drawers. Behind one drawer, they placed a preferred meal (such as live grass shrimp) and behind the other, they placed a less preferred meal (such as Asian shore crab). The doors had symbols on them that indicated whether it would open with a delay (a triangle) or open immediately (a circle), which the cuttlefish learned to recognize. The drawer with the less preferred meal always opened to the cuttlefish immediately, but the other drawer opened after a delay. In the control condition, the door with the preferred snack didn\\'t open at all (a square). When the cuttlefish approached one chamber, the researchers immediately removed the snack in the other.  The cuttlefish indeed chose to delay gratification to score a more delicious meal if they knew the door would open after a delay; they were able to delay grabbing their snack for anywhere between 50 to 130 seconds. During this time, they generally sat at the bottom of the tank looking at the two rewards, Schnell told Live Science in an email. Sometimes, they would even turn away from the immediate (less preferred but currently available) option \"as if to distract themselves from the temptation of the immediate reward,\" she said. This same distraction technique was previously observed in humans, chimpanzees, jays, parrots and dogs, she said. \"Why cuttlefish evolved the ability to exert self-control is a bit of a mystery,\" Schnell said. \"This finding is an extreme example of convergent evolution because cuttlefish have significantly different evolutionary histories from the more commonly studied apes, corvids and parrots, and yet they share the same cognitive feature.\" (Convergent evolution occurs when different species evolve similar traits independently of one another.) \"Cuttlefish can tolerate delays to obtain the food of higher quality comparable to that of some large-brained vertebrates,\" the authors wrote in the study. Those include great apes, parrots and corvids. But the benefits of self-control for such social and long-lived animals \"are obvious,\" Schnell said. If these animals resist temptation now, they may have better outcomes in the future and live a longer life. For example, these animals may wait for others to eat to strengthen social bonds or forego hunting and foraging to give themselves time to craft tools in order to optimize hunting and foraging in the future, she said. The benefits for cuttlefish are less obvious. \"Cuttlefish are not long-lived, not social and do not manufacture or build tools,\" Schnell said. — Photos: see the world\\'s cutest sea creatures — 7 ways animals are like humans — 10 amazing things you didn\\'t know about animals The researchers hypothesize that the cuttlefish evolved self-control as a byproduct of an unrelated trait: camouflage. To avoid being detected by predators, cuttlefish need to spend long periods of their day in hiding, taking only brief breaks to forage. \"Thus, perhaps self-control evolved to optimize their foraging behavior and reduce their predator exposure,\" she added. The researchers also tested whether the degree of self-control in cuttlefish was linked to higher intelligence, or in this case, the ability of the cuttlefish to learn. To do this, they trained the cuttlefish to associate the reward with various stimuli; cuttlefish that exerted more self-control (waited longer to get their food) had a better ability to learn, according to the findings. To link self-control to intelligence researchers need to study how the cuttlefish perform in other cognitive tests such as spatial memory and object permanence, which means an understanding that an object continues to exist regardless of whether you can see it, Schnell said. The findings were published Tuesday (March 2) in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Renaissance-era letter sealed for centuries just virtually unfolded and read for the first time',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'More than 600 years ago, someone intricately folded, sealed and posted a letter that was never delivered. Now, scientists have digitally \"unfolded\" this and other similarly locked letters found in a 17th-century trunk in The Hague, using X-rays. For centuries prior to the invention of sealed envelopes, sensitive correspondence was protected from prying eyes through complex folding techniques called \"letterlocking,\" which transformed a letter into its own secure envelope. However, locked letters that survive to the present are fragile and can be opened physically only by slicing them to pieces. The new X-ray method offers researchers a non-invasive alternative, maintaining a letterpacket\\'s original folded shape. For the first time, scientists applied this method to \"locked\" letters from the Renaissance period, kept in a trunk that had been in the collection of the Dutch postal museum in The Hague, The Netherlands, since 1926. Related: Photos: Treasure trove of unopened 17th-century letters The trunk\\'s contents include more than 3,100 undelivered letters, of which 577 were unopened and letterlocked. Known as the Brienne Collection, the letters were written in Dutch, English, French, Italian, Latin and Spanish. For unknown reasons, once the missives reached The Hague they were never delivered to their intended recipients, and were instead kept by a postmaster named Simon de Brienne, Live Science previously reported. Locked letters used different mechanisms to stay securely closed, including folds and rolls; slits and holes; tucks and adhesives; and a variety of cleverly constructed locks, according to a study published online March 2 in the journal Nature Communications. To penetrate the layers of folded paper, the study authors used an X‐ray microtomography scanner engineered in the dental research labs at Queen Mary University of London (QMU). Researchers designed the scanner to be exceptionally sensitive so that it could map the mineral content of teeth, \"which is invaluable in dental research,\" study co-author Graham Davis, a QMU professor of 3D X-ray imaging, said in a statement. \"But this high sensitivity has also made it possible to resolve certain types of ink in paper and parchment,\" Davis added.  – Cracking codices: 10 of the most mysterious ancient manuscripts – Photos: Renaissance world map sports magical creatures – Breaking the code: Why yuor barin can raed tihs \"The rest of the team were then able to take our scan images and turn them into letters they could open virtually and read for the first time in over 300 years,\" study co-author David Mills, an X-ray microtomography facilities manager at QMU, said in the statement. From the scans, the team built 3D digital reconstructions of the letters, and then created a computational algorithm that deciphered the sophisticated folding techniques, crease by crease, opening the letters virtually \"while preserving letterlocking evidence,\" according to the study.  The scientists digitally opened four letters using this groundbreaking method, deciphering the contents of one letter, DB-1627. Penned on July 31, 1697, it was written by a man named Jacques Sennacques to his cousin Pierre Le Pers, who lived in The Hague. Sennacques, a legal professional in Lille, France, requested an official death certificate for a relative named Daniel Le Pers, \"perhaps due to a question of\\xa0inheritance,\" the scientists wrote. \"His request issued, Sennacques then spends the rest of the letter asking for news of the family and commending his cousin to the graces of God,\" the authors wrote. \"We do not know exactly why Le Pers did not receive Sennacques\\' letter, but given the itinerancy of merchants, it is likely that Le Pers had moved on.\" Tens of thousands of such sealed documents can now be unfolded and read virtually, the researchers reported. \"This algorithm takes us right into the heart of a locked letter,\" the research team said in the statement. \"Using virtual unfolding to read an intimate story that has never seen the light of day — and never even reached its recipient — is truly extraordinary.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Rare Australian bee rediscovered after nearly a century',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'An extremely rare species of bee that hasn\\'t been seen for nearly a century and was thought to be extinct has been rediscovered by a lone researcher in Australia. This rare \"masked\" bee, known as Pharohylaeus lactiferus, is native to Australia and is the only species in the genus Pharohylaeus. It is similar in size to the invasive European honeybee (Apis mellifera). Only six individuals have been previously identified in Australia and the last one was reported in 1923. But the bee was recently rediscovered by James Dorey, a doctoral candidate at Flinders University, while completing fieldwork in the state of Queensland. After the chance rediscovery, Dorey conducted a larger survey of Queensland and New South Wales dedicated to searching for P. lactiferus. Related: Gorgeous images of Australian \\'rainbow\\' bees will blow your mind \"I never really expected to find any,\" Dorey told Live Science. \"But we have caught many times more bees now than we did back then.\" His research on the bees suggests that deforestation and forest fires could be putting them at risk of extinction, for good this time. The rediscovery of P. lactiferus was a lucky accident for Dorey. \"Knowing that P. lactiferus hadn\\'t been found for so long meant that I was keeping an eye open for it as I sampled my way up the coast,\" Dorey said. \"Once I managed to find the first specimen I had a place to start and the opportunity to look for more.\" After the discovery Dorey spent five months surveying 245 sites across Queensland and New South Wales in search for more of the masked bees. Dorey focused his efforts on certain flowering plants that were similar to those where he found the first individual. The sampling involved a combination of both watching flowers to see if the bees visited them and \"general sweeps\" with a butterfly net above the flowers.  The survey revealed three geographically isolated populations of the masked bees across Australia\\'s eastern coast. Each population lives in patches of tropical and subtropical rainforest with a specific vegetation type. Dorey thinks that the bees are particularly dependent on firewheel trees (Stenocarpus sinuatus) and Illawarra flame trees (Brachychiton acerifolius). The survey has identified more individuals of P. lactiferus than ever before. But due to poor historic records there is no way of knowing if the masked bee populations have increased or decreased over time, according to Dorey. Although the bees\\' may live in isolated populations because they strongly prefer certain habitats, Dorey also suspects that deforestation and increasingly severe and numerous wildfires could also be playing a role in their isolation. \"Where these bees have been found, that rainforest type has undergone habitat destruction and fragmentation,\" Dorey said. \"This means that there is less of this habitat available,\" and that makes it \"harder for [the bees] to move between what\\'s left.\" Unfortunately, rising temperatures caused by climate change will only worsen wildfires, and deforestation is only continuing, which means \"these potential threats are likely to get worse,\" Dorey said. \"Smaller, and lower-quality fragments might make it more likely that P. lactiferus will go extinct in each fragment, and less likely that it will be able to recolonize from another,\" Dorey said. Therefore, protecting these habitat fragments is key to their survival. — 7 Insects you\\'ll be eating in the future — 21 totally sweet spider superlatives — Images: Tiny life revealed in stunning microscope photos However, protecting species is impossible without tracking the bees\\' numbers as well as changes in their habitats. \"Without it we have no idea what\\'s going on in ecosystems,\" Dorey said. \"If we did not go and look, then species declines would certainly go unnoticed and the protection of species would be impossible.\" The study was published online Feb. 25 in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research.

       "  'Full Article': 'Two ancient stone coffins that may have once held the remains of a husband and wife have been rediscovered in a wildlife park near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. They are thought to be about 1,800 years old, dating from the period when the Roman Empire ruled the region. The stone coffins, or sarcophagi, were found mid-February, hidden near enclosures for giraffes, elephants and a bird nursery. Some of the park\\'s older staff recalled that the coffins had first been discovered about 25 years ago during the construction of a new parking lot. But they were dug up, moved elsewhere at the site, and then forgotten again, until they were rediscovered during work on a new extension for the park\\'s animal hospital. \"They are two matching coffins … decorated identically with garlands and discs,\" Uzi Rothstein of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), said in a statement. The similarities of the coffins is what led Rothstein and his colleagues to speculate they belonged to a couple.\" Related: Photos: 2000-year-old Roman road and coins discovered in Israel Experts think the ornate decorations show the coffins were meant for non-Jewish people of high social status during the period, when the region was dominated by the ancient port city of Jaffa and the Roman provincial capital of Caesarea was about 20 miles (32 kilometers) to the north. Archaeologists have now transferred the coffins into a nearby repository for Israeli National Treasures.  The Ramat Gan Safari Park was built on the site of a small zoo founded in 1958 and opened in 1974 with the largest collection of wildlife under human care in the Middle East. It\\'s now a 250-acre (100 hectares) drive-through park that features zebras, lions, giraffes, elephants, hippos and other animals. According to the IAA statement, construction workers clearing land for the new extension of the animal hospital saw the two stone coffins jutting out of the soil. After clearing away thick vegetation and the sand surrounding the coffins, they alerted staff at the park who got in touch with Rothstein and his colleagues. Rothstein said they were astonished to see such ancient artifacts at the wildlife park, and that the contractor who first discovered them 25 years ago probably didn\\'t realize their significance. \"The contractor cleared two stone structures and transported them to a farther area without having any idea of what he was dealing with,\" he said. The coffins are made from stone that likely came from the Judaean Hills or Samaria close by, possibly in imitation of prestigious sarcophagi made from Proconnesian marble from the Turkish island of Marmara. Their decorations include symbolic discs intended to protect and accompany the soul on its journey to an afterlife, and stone garlands of flowers. The decorations also included oval blank spaces on the stone between the garlands, which the archaeologists think were intended for customary grape-cluster motifs; but for some reason the work on the coffins remained unfinished, Rothstein said.      The region where the coffins were found came under the control of the expanding Roman Empire in 63 B.C., after Roman legions under the general Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus — Pompey the Great — defeated the forces of the ruling kingdom of Pontus in the Third Mithridatic War. The Romans initially ruled the region as part of the province of Syria, and they established a client kingdom there — named Judea, after the ancient Israelite kingdom of Judah — under Herod the Great in 37 B.C. A few years after Herod\\'s death in 1 B.C., the Emperor Augustus deposed Herod\\'s unpopular son Archelaus and the region became directly controlled by Rome as the province of Judea.

The Ramat Gan Safari Park is close to the site of the biblical city of Beneberak, which is famous in Jewish writings as the home of the sage Rabbi Akiva ben Yosef — the spiritual leader of the Bar Kokhba revolt; he was executed by the Romans in 135. \"It could be that the sarcophagi are connected to the ancient city, it could be that they are not,\" Rothstein told the Jerusalem Post. \"It is very rare to find sarcophagi in general and especially in their original site.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Planetary defense experts use infamous asteroid Apophis to practice spotting dangerous space rocks',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Earth\\'s most recent brush with asteroid danger was eight years ago, when a space rock the size of a six-story building came seemingly out of nowhere, injuring 1,200 people when it exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia. Now, scientists are using this month\\'s flyby of the infamous asteroid Apophis to test their responses to potentially hazardous space rocks, honing the fine art of planetary defense. Planetary defense focuses on identifying asteroids and comets that hang out around Earth, mapping their precise paths and seeing how their orbits compare with Earth\\'s. If an orbital model shows that an asteroid and Earth are due to reach the same place at the same time, things get serious, particularly when the space rock is large. That\\'s the sort of scenario that ended the dinosaurs\\' reign, after all. But planetary defense isn\\'t hopeless: if humans identify a dangerous asteroid long enough before impact, we could theoretically do something to divert it. Related: Scientists prepare for their last good look at asteroid Apophis before 2029 flyby Successfully preventing damage from an asteroid impact will depend on spotting the threat in time, which takes practice. But although scientists have identified more than 25,000 near-Earth asteroids to date, the majority are too small to cause much worry. So while there are plenty of asteroids rattling around Earth\\'s orbit, most aren\\'t big enough or close enough to trigger realistic existential angst. Apophis came to its fame because it isn\\'t like most of these near-Earth space rocks. When scientists discovered it in 2004, it stood out right away. First, it is relatively large — more than 1,000 feet (300 meters) wide, around the height of the Eiffel Tower, according to NASA. And models based on early observations suggested a nearly 3% chance Apophis would collide with Earth on April 13, 2029. More precise observations soon put the fear of impact that year to rest, but the early concern surrounding the asteroid prompted its name, which references an Egyptian \"demon serpent who personified evil and chaos,\" as NASA put it. Right now, scientists are confident that Apophis is no threat to Earth for at least a few decades. But the space rock will still come visiting next month, offering scientists valuable opportunities to get a close look at a relatively large asteroid. And, with a little imagination, these flybys can also serve as planetary defense rehearsals. \"The goal is to basically wrangle all the scientists from around the world, kind of the coalition of the willing,\" Vishnu Reddy, a planetary defense expert at the University of Arizona who is coordinating the project, told Space.com. \"Then we go on this months-long campaign, trying to observe this object.\" Related: Huge asteroid Apophis flies by Earth on Friday the 13th in 2029, a lucky day for scientists Apophis will fly past Earth on March 5. The asteroid will remain about one-tenth the average Earth-sun distance away — a downright mundane flyby compared to the 2029 event, when Apophis will pass by at about the altitude at which particularly high satellites orbit. To mark this year\\'s flyby, the International Asteroid Warning Network instituted its third such campaign. Previously, scientists have practiced on an asteroid called 2012 TC4 and on 1999 KW4, which is a pair of rocks circling each other. For Apophis, about 40 scientists from 13 different countries have signed on. These observers are pretending that Apophis has never been seen before, which means they are starting from scratch in terms of evaluating how much danger the asteroid poses to Earth. \"It\\'s not a scientific goal,\" Reddy said. \"The goal is to get new observations as if we don\\'t know anything about this object and try and see where in the process we need to improve efficiency and also identify the human factor. Anybody dealing with scientists knows that it\\'s like herding cats, and when you do that on an international scale, there\\'s part diplomacy, part science, and part planetary defense.\" Reddy said that the coincidence of the Apophis flyby occurring during the continuing COVID-19 pandemic offered an opportunity to understand how resilient the asteroid detection system is. At this point, most telescopes are managing to continue operating, although he said the pandemic likely would have interfered much more had the flyby occurred a year earlier, when institutions were still scrambling to respond. \"There\\'s a reasonable amount of redundancy in planetary defense,\" he said. \"Even if one telescope goes down or we lose a certain thing, it\\'s not like the whole community goes down, to some extent.\" Campaign members first definitively identified Apophis around Dec. 19, thanks to a space-based instrument called NEOWISE. After the spacecraft, originally an astrophysics mission, lost the ability to keep itself cool, scientists reinvented it to identify new asteroids. That the first discovery credit went to NEOWISE was unusual, however. These days, most new asteroids are discovered by ground-based surveys, particularly the Pan-STARRS telescopes in Hawaii and the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona. But Apophis was tricky for Earth-based telescopes to discover this time around, Reddy said. \"The challenge was that its motion and the way it was moving, it was hard to do it with short observing arcs,\" he said. NEOWISE is never pulled away from a target by the Earth\\'s rotation, and since it studies infrared light, it can observe during day and night alike. \"NEOWISE got it first, and that\\'s because of where we look in the sky and the wavelengths that we use to search for it,\" Amy Mainzer, an astronomer at the University of Arizona and principal investigator for NEOWISE, told Space.com. \"To get to, quote-unquote, discover Apophis was really fun.\" There\\'s a perk to spotting a new asteroid with NEOWISE: The instrument can quickly determine the size of a space rock. Telescopes that identify asteroids using optical light have trouble distinguishing between larger dark rocks and smaller light rocks; NEOWISE\\'s infrared sight eliminates that confusion. Related: Defending Earth against dangerous asteroids: Q&A with NASA\\'s Lindley Johnson And for this \"discovery\" of Apophis, the initial optical appearance turned out to be more menacing than NEOWISE\\'s calculated diameter. \"You can quickly tell if it\\'s going to be a global catastrophe or just regional because you can get the size quickly,\" Mainzer said. \"It makes an orders of magnitude difference in the prediction of hazard.\" While a newly discovered asteroid may initially sport a slight chance of impact, additional observations typically whittle that chance to nothing. \"For Apophis, if you start afresh, assuming that we don\\'t know anything about it and we just discovered it with NEOWISE and we\\'re following it up, there is a reasonable impact risk from Apophis,\" Reddy said. It\\'s worth emphasizing that \"reasonable impact risk\" appears only in the scenario they\\'re practicing, not in the reality of scientists\\' full knowledge of the asteroid. \"Of course, if you include the historical observations, it goes away, because we know its orbit very well, it\\'s not going to hit us,\" Reddy said. Good news for humans, but that disappearing impact risk isn\\'t helpful to the practice session. \"That\\'s not what we\\'re looking for, we want to see what are the effects on the ground,\" Reddy said. So at some point, the campaign will part with reality, and, in the safe confines of computer models, scientists will nudge Apophis toward Earth. Altering the asteroid\\'s trajectory lets planetary defense specialists practice each stage of the asteroid response process, the point, after all, of the campaign. Apophis has become much easier to observe since its \"discovery\"; by now, Reddy said, amateur astronomers can spot it with a decent backyard telescope, and he looks forward to including them in the project. Meanwhile, for scientists, the initial hustle of \"discovery\" has calmed somewhat. \"There\\'s a huge flurry of activity, and then there\\'s not a whole lot in the middle for five or six weeks,\" Reddy said. The team, ignoring old data about Apophis, already has much of the information a planetary defense expert would want, data that helps scientists determine an object\\'s shape or composition. \"The key event after this point, I think, is the radar observations,\" he said; these observations should begin March 3. Planetary radar observations, which bounce a beam of radio waves off an object then catch the echo, are the most powerful tool scientists have to study the precise shape and location of an asteroid. These observations are often the final data scientists need to confirm that an asteroid will safely pass by Earth. The responsibility for those observations will fall to NASA\\'s Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California, after the December collapse of the radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Related: Losing Arecibo\\'s giant dish leaves humans more vulnerable to space rocks, scientists say But NEOWISE isn\\'t done with Apophis either, Mainzer said. Although the instrument moved onto other work after the \"discovery,\" the asteroid will be back in the NEOWISE field of view after its close approach. \"We\\'re almost certain to detect it again in April,\" she said. That will be another valuable science opportunity. \"If we see it in December, we look at it from one direction; when we get it in April, we\\'re probably going to see from a different direction, right?\" Mainzer said. By seeing Apophis multiple times at different angles, scientists may be able to get a glimpse of the space rock\\'s surface. \"We can combine that information to hopefully pull out some details, I\\'m hoping we can get some details of the surface roughness, the thickness of any rocks and dust on the surface of the object,\" Mainzer said. \"It may help us learn quite a bit more about it, if we\\'re very lucky.\" Email Meghan Bartels at mbartels@space.com or follow her on Twitter @meghanbartels.

       "  'Title': 'Lab-grown black hole analog behaves just like Stephen Hawking said it would',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'In 1974, Stephen Hawking theorized that the universe\\'s darkest gravitational behemoths, black holes, were not the pitch-black star swallowers astronomers imagined, but they spontaneously emitted light — a phenomenon now dubbed Hawking radiation. The problem is, no astronomer has ever observed Hawking\\'s mysterious radiation, and because it is predicted to be very dim, they may never will. Which is why scientists today are creating their own black holes. Researchers at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology did just that. They created a black hole analog out of a few thousand atoms. They were trying to confirm two of Hawking\\'s most important predictions, that Hawking radiation arises from nothing and that it does not change in intensity over time, meaning it\\'s stationary. \"A black hole is supposed to radiate like a black body, which is essentially a warm object that emits a constant infrared radiation,\" study co-author Jeff Steinhauer, an associate professor of physics at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, told Phys.org. \"Hawking suggested that black holes are just like regular stars, which radiate a certain type of radiation all the time, constantly. That\\'s what we wanted to confirm in our study, and we did.\" Related: The 12 strangest objects in the universe The gravity of a black hole is so powerful that not even light can escape its grasp, once a photon, or light particle, crosses beyond its point-of-no-return, called the \\xa0event horizon. To escape this boundary, a particle would have to break the laws of physics and travel faster than the speed of light. Hawking showed that although nothing that crosses the event horizon can escape, black holes can still spontaneously emit light from the boundary, thanks to quantum mechanics and something called \"virtual particles.\" As explained by Heisenberg\\'s uncertainty principle, even the complete vacuum of space is teeming with pairs of \\'virtual\\' particles that pop in and out of existence. These fleeting particles with opposite energies usually annihilate each other almost immediately. But due to the extreme gravitational pull at an event horizon, Hawking suggested pairs of photons could be separated, with one particle getting absorbed by the black hole and the other escaping into space. The absorbed photon has negative energy and subtracts energy in the form of mass from the black hole, while the escaped photon becomes Hawking radiation. From this alone, given enough time (much longer than the age of the universe), a black hole could completely evaporate away. \"Hawking\\'s theory was revolutionary because he combined the physics of quantum field theory with general relativity,\" Einstein\\'s theory that describes how matter warps space-time,Steinhauer told Live Science. \"It\\'s still helping people to look for new laws of physics by studying the combination of these two theories in a physical example. People would like to verify this quantum radiation, but it\\'s very difficult with a real black hole because Hawking radiation is so weak compared to the background radiation of space.\" This problem inspired Steinhauer and his colleagues to create their own black hole — a safer and much smaller one than the real deal. The researchers\\' lab-grown black hole was made of a flowing gas of approximately 8,000 rubidium atoms cooled to nearly absolute zero and held in place by a laser beam. They created a mysterious state of matter, known as a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), which allows thousands of atoms to \\xa0act together in unison as though they were a single atom. Using a second laser beam, the team created a cliff of potential energy, which caused the gas to flow like water rushing down a waterfall, thereby creating an event horizon where one half of the gas was flowing faster than the speed of sound, the other half slower. In this experiment, the team was looking for pairs of phonons, or quantum sounds waves, instead of pairs of photons,spontaneously forming in the gas. —10 huge black hole findings from 2020 —What happens at the center of a black hole? —The 18 biggest unsolved mysteries in physics A phonon on the slower half could travel against the flow of gas, away from the cliff, while the phonon on the faster half became trapped by the speed of the supersonic flowing gas, Steinhauer explained. \"It\\'s like trying to swim against a current that\\'s faster than you can swim. [That\\'s] just like being in a black hole, once you\\'re inside, it\\'s impossible to reach the horizon.\" Once they found these phonon pairs, the researchers had to confirm whether they were correlated and if the Hawking radiation remained constant over time (if it was stationary). That process was tricky because every time they took a picture of their black hole, it was destroyed by the heat created in the process. So the team repeated their experiment 97,000 times, taking more than 124 days of continuous measurements in order to find the correlations. In the end, their patience paid off. \"We showed that the Hawking radiation was stationary, meaning it didn\\'t change with time, which is exactly what Hawking predicted,\" Steinhauer said. The researchers detailed their findings Jan. 4 in the journal Nature Physics. Originally published on Live Science.

       "  'Title': 'Cats are too socially inept to be loyal',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'In the cat world, there\\'s a saying that you should keep your humans\\' friends close and your humans\\' enemies … just as close. That\\'s the takeaway of a new study that shows that cats, unlike dogs, will gladly accept food from people who are not nice to their owners. While dog lovers may rejoice at the chance for another study suggesting dogs are more loyal than cats, the conclusion is not that simple. It might not be that cats are disloyal; rather, they may be too socially clueless to understand when someone is not being nice to their owners, according to the new study, which was published in the February issue of the journal Animal Behavior and Cognition. For the study, a group of researchers from Kyoto University in Japan tested the loyalty of domestic cats by adapting a technique previously used on dogs. The experiment involved a container, 36 domestic cats (13 were house cats and 23 lived in cat cafés) and their owners. Related: 20 weird dog and cat behaviors explained by science The researchers set up two groups: the \"helpers\" and the \"non-helpers.\" The cats watched as their owners tried in vain to open a container and take out an object. In the helper group, a second person, an actor, helped the owner open the container — in other words, they acted as a friend to the owner. In the non-helper group, the actor refused to help and turned away — making them a foe. To act as a point of comparison, a third person just sat there throughout both conditions, neither helping nor refusing to help. After the skit, the actor and the neutral person from each trial offered the cat a piece of food, and the experimenters recorded which person the cat took the food from. After four trials, the conclusion was clear: The cats did not care who they took the food from. Previously, the research team showed that dogs undergoing the same experiment avoided people who refused to help their owners. So does this mean dogs are loyal and cats are selfish? Not quite. \"It is conceivable that the cats in this study did not understand the meaning or goal of the owners\\' behavior,\" the authors wrote. No studies have investigated if cats can recognize others\\' goals or intentions from their actions, they wrote. \"But even if they did understand the owner\\'s goal or intention, they might have failed to detect the negative intention of the non-helpful actor.\" In other words, they may not have realized the other person was not helping their owner open the container. \"We consider that cats might not possess the same social evaluation abilities as dogs, at least in this situation, because unlike the latter, they have not been selected to cooperate with humans,\" the authors wrote in the study. (Throughout the years, dogs were breeded, or artificially \"selected\" for more cooperative traits.) — Ringtail cats: Photos of the \\'cutest animal in North America\\' — In photos: America\\'s favorite pets — 11 ways your beloved pet may make you sick Calling cats selfish based on this study would be an \"anthropomorphic bias,\" Ali Boyle, a research fellow in the Kinds of Intelligence project at the University of Cambridge, wrote in The Conversation. They\\'re not \"furry little humans,\" but \"creatures with their own distinctive ways of thinking,\" wrote Boyle, who was not involved in the new study. It\\'s more likely that cats don\\'t understand our social relationships as much as dogs do, because dogs were domesticated much earlier, she wrote. What\\'s more, the ancestors of dogs lived in social packs, whereas cats were solitary hunters, which could mean dogs already had existing social skills that were hyperdeveloped when they were domesticated. It\\'s also not clear if these findings extend to all house cats. \"About two thirds of our subjects were from cat cafés, which makes us cautious about generalizing the results of this study to all domestic cats,\" the researchers wrote in the study. Though the house cats and the café cats didn\\'t show differences in behavior, they could have a different bond to their owners. Café cats, for example, may spend more time socializing with strangers and may have less individual interactions with their owners than house cats would, they wrote.

       "  'Full Article': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) can now transform photos of people into short, highly realistic animations, much like the moving pictures in the newspapers and posters of Harry Potter\\'s magical world. In these AI-animated clips, faces that were once frozen in time blink, turn their heads and even smile, their movements wavering between astonishingly lifelike and deeply unsettling (and yes, downright creepy). Genealogy website MyHeritage introduced the animation engine on Feb. 25. Developed by technology company D-ID and known as Deep Nostalgia, it enables users to animate photos via the MyHeritage website, representatives said in a blog post. D-ID designed custom algorithms that recreate the naturalistic movement of human faces digitally, applying those subtle movements to photographs and modifying facial expressions that move as human faces normally do, according to the D-ID website. Related: Can machines be creative? Meet 9 AI \\'artists\\' When AIs create original video footage, often referred to as \"deepfake,\" they do so using a method called generative adversarial networks, or GANs. This technique pits two AIs against each other; one produces content and the other evaluates how well that content emulates the real thing. Over time, the algorithms drive each other to become better, until the original AI content is very hard to identify as fake. Such videos can be used in troubling ways: from showing political figures making fake speeches, to adding the faces of famous actresses to the bodies of actresses in pornographic movies, Vice reported in 2018. However, video clips generated by Deep Nostalgia are just a few seconds long, and the training footage for the AI did not include speech, so as to prevent the creation of deepfakes, according to MyHeritage.  – 5 intriguing uses for artificial intelligence (that aren\\'t killer robots) – Artificial intelligence: Friendly or frightening? – Intelligent\\xa0machines to space colonies: 5 sci-fi visions of the future Programmers trained Deep Nostalgia\\'s GAN with sets of \"blueprint videos,\" each representing different combinations of movements for eyes, mouths, eyebrows, cheeks and heads; the AI then learned how these could be applied to photos of different people to achieve an illusion of realistic motion. It assigns different suites of facial gestures to different photos, depending on their subjects\\' postures and orientations, according to MyHeritage. Results in the animations can vary, depending on the quality of the original image and how the person in the photo posed. The illusion tends to be most effective when the subject is facing the camera, and the end result can be less convincing when the algorithm has to create digital information to represent something that was missing in the original picture, \"such as teeth or ears,\" MyHeritage representatives said.  Deep Nostalgia may also struggle to realistically incorporate accessories such as hats or glasses, which can obscure parts of the face and head. In those cases, \"sometimes the simulated movement works well — and other times it does not,\" according to the site. While MyHeritage encouraged users to test Deep Nostalgia with family photos, Twitter users shared examples of some famous faces from the past, such as the poet Emily Dickinson; chemist and X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin; and abolitionist Frederick Douglass.

       "  'Title': 'Link found between cannabis and rebound headaches after migraine',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'People with chronic migraines who use cannabis products are much more likely to suffer from \"rebound headaches\" than those who don\\'t use the drugs, a preliminary study suggests. However, though a link has been uncovered, it\\'s still unclear whether cannabis directly triggers the rebound headaches, the study authors told Live Science. The study also didn\\'t specify what types of cannabis products the patients used, so it\\'s unknown whether certain products show a greater correlation to rebound headaches than others. A rebound headache, also known as a medication-overuse headache (MOH), happens when a person who already has a headache disorder, such as chronic migraine, either develops a new kind of headache or their existing headaches significantly worsen over time because they are taking headache medication too frequently, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD 3). A formal diagnosis of rebound headaches means that a person has regularly overused one or more drugs to treat their headaches for more than three months. That usually means taking pain-relieving or antimigraine medications more than two or three days a week, according to Harvard Health. In addition, a diagnosed person will have experienced headaches on 15 or more days each month. The rebound headaches usually resolve if patients stop overusing the medications. Related: Ouch: 10 odd causes of headaches These headaches affect about 1% to 3% of people in the general population and nearly one-third of the patients who seek treatment for headaches at specialized clinics, such as the Stanford Headache Center, study author Dr. Niushen Zhang, a clinical assistant professor and director of the Headache Fellowship Program at Stanford University School of Medicine, told Live Science in an email. Now, in their new study, Zhang and her colleagues found that people with chronic migraines appear six times more likely to experience rebound headaches if they use cannabis, as compared with migraine patients who don\\'t use the drug. The scientists will present the unpublished research at the American Academy of Neurology\\'s 73rd Annual Meeting, to be held virtually in April. \"This study shows that there is some kind of association between cannabis use and medication-overuse headache in people with chronic migraine,\" Zhang said. However, the research is still in its early days, and \"it is unclear at this time whether patients are using cannabis to treat medication-overuse headache or if cannabis is contributing to the development [of] medication-overuse headache, or both,\" Zhang said. Future studies will be needed to determine whether cannabis contributes to the emergence of rebound headaches, and if so, what that means for those with chronic migraines, she said. For now, \"it is too early to provide any clinical recommendations based on the current findings,\" Zhang added. Zhang and her colleagues launched their study after noticing that a number of their patients with both chronic migraines and MOH also used cannabis products, she said. As there is very little research on cannabis use and these headache disorders, the team decided to explore the association further. \"Our study is the first of its kind to assess the risk of medication-overuse headache in chronic migraine patients who use cannabis,\" Zhang said. —CBD and CBD oil: What is it and does it really work? —9 weird ways you can test positive for drugs —7 absolutely horrible head infections The team pulled data from the Stanford Research Repository Cohort Discovery Tool, collecting information on chronic migraine patients treated between 2015 and 2019. They included 368 adults who had experienced chronic migraine for at least a year; 150 reported using cannabis products, and 218 did not use any. The team then assessed which patients had been diagnosed with MOH, taking other variables into account, such as how often they got migraines, how long they\\'d been using cannabis, when they got diagnosed with MOH and what other medications they took for headaches. They found that 212 patients had MOH, and that patients who reported cannabis use were far more likely to be diagnosed with the disorder. There was also a significant link between cannabis use, opioid use and rebound headaches, they found. \"Some of the patients in the study who were using cannabis were also taking, or had a history of taking, opioids,\" Zhang said. Again, future studies will need to investigate if and how these drugs raise the risk of rebound headaches, as well as what happens when people take them simultaneously. The cannabinoids in cannabis products bind to receptors in the body that regulate the perception of pain, and there is evidence that cannabis products can help alleviate certain types of chronic pain, Live Science previously reported. That said, since this new study reveals a potential link between the drugs and rebound headaches, more research will be needed to see whether cannabis sets migraine patients up for worse headaches, Zhang said. Again, for now, it\\'s too early to say for sure. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': \"Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano, has been belching ash, smoke and lava over the Sicilian countryside for more than two weeks now. Fortunately, no injuries, evacuations or serious damage have resulted from the volcano's latest spurt of activity. But the eruptions — many occurring at night — have drawn the world's awe and attention with their eerie displays of light and lava. During a series of eruptions between Feb. 20 and 23, fountains of lava soared up to 0.9 miles (1.5 kilometers) over Etna's summit — roughly three times the height of One World Trade Center in New York, according to NASA. In one particularly striking photo, shown below, oozing tendrils of magma spread out of the darkness toward a church in Catania, Italy. It's an impressive illusion; downtown Catania, more than 15 miles (25 km) from the volcano crater, is in no danger from the eruption, according to the Associated Press (AP).   During its long history (geologists believe Etna formed more than 350,000 years ago), the volcano has occasionally turned lethal. The deadliest historical eruption by far occurred in 1669, when the volcano spewed continuously from March to July. This became known as the Great Eruption. —The 11 biggest volcanic eruptions in history —50 amazing volcano facts —5 colossal cones: Biggest volcanoes on Earth Early in the Great Eruption, several fissures cracked open on the southeastern side of the volcano, according to Brittanica.com, unleashing a river of lava, ash and rock over the countryside. The flow destroyed a dozen towns and briefly overtook the city walls of Catania, submerging the town's western quarter before oozing onward into the sea. No one knows exactly how many died in the Great Eruption, but later reports estimated thousands of deaths. During the current, relatively mild eruption, ash has posed a bigger problem than lava. Sicily's Catania Airport was temporarily closed due to the ash column, and residents of small towns closer to the volcano have had to deal with an occasional raining of ash and stones, the AP reported.

       "  'Title': 'Quick guide: COVID-19 vaccines in use and how they work',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Editor\\'s note: This article was last updated at 1:30pm on March 1. The original article was posted on Jan. 11. Dozens of coronavirus vaccines entered clinical trials during 2020, and now, a handful have been authorized for emergency use in various countries — meaning the shots can be administered to the public while their developers continue to collect data on their safety and efficacy. Should they meet all the necessary criteria, these vaccines could be fully approved in the future, and in some places, they already have been. Here\\'s a quick guide to the COVID-19 vaccines now in use around the world. Related: 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history The vaccine developed by Pfizer and German biotechnology company BioNTech is 95% effective at preventing COVID-19, a large study found. The vaccine is administered in two doses, given three weeks apart, and it must be stored at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 70 degrees Celsius). On Dec. 11, 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine became the first COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Several other countries have also authorized the vaccine for emergency use, including the U.K., Argentina, Chile and Singapore, and the European Union followed suit on Dec. 21, The New York Times reported. Bahrain, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Switzerland have fully approved the vaccine. On Jan. 25, Australia gave the vaccine \"provisional approval\" for use in people aged 16 and over, The Associated Press reported. The shot uses a molecule called mRNA as its base. A molecular cousin of DNA, mRNA contains instructions to build specific proteins; in this case, the mRNA in the vaccine codes for the coronavirus spike protein, a structure that sticks off the virus\\'s surface and is used to infect human cells. Once inside the body, the vaccine instructs human cells to build this protein, and the immune system learns to recognize and attack it. The vaccine developed by U.S. biotech company Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) also uses mRNA as its base and is estimated to be 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19. Like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it\\'s delivered in two doses, but the doses are given four weeks apart, rather than three. Another difference is that the Moderna vaccine can be stored at at minus 4 F (minus 20 C), rather than requiring deep-freezing like the Pfizer shots. The FDA authorized the Moderna vaccine for emergency use on Dec. 18, and Israel and the European Medicines Agency, an agency of the European Union, both authorized the shots for emergency use in January, according to the Times. Canada fully approved the vaccine on Dec. 23. The vaccine developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is estimated to be about 70% effective at preventing COVID-19 — that said, in clinical trials, adjusting the dose seemed to boost this efficacy. In people given two full-size doses, spaced 28 days apart, the vaccine was about 62% effective; in those given a half-dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine was 90% effective, according to early analyses. However, clinical trial participants who got half-doses did so by mistake, and some scientists have questioned whether those early results are representative. The U.K. and Argentina authorized the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for emergency use in late December, and India and Mexico authorized the vaccine for emergency use in January, according to the Times. The EU\\'s European Medicines Agency authorized the vaccine for use in adults on Jan. 29, The Associated Press reported. \\xa0Canada approved the vaccine on Feb. 26, CTV News reported. The shots contain a weakened version of adenovirus, a common cold virus that naturally infects chimpanzees. Scientists modified the virus so it cannot replicate in human cells and then added genes that code for the coronavirus spike protein. Inside the body, the vaccine enters cells and delivers these spike protein genes, which the cells use to build the spike protein itself. The presence of spike proteins triggers an immune response.  The vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson\\'s Janssen showed a 72% overall efficacy rate in the U.S. and 64% in South Africa, where a highly-transmissible coronavirus variant is causing most new cases, according to an FDA analysis conducted in February, the Times reported. In terms of preventing severe disease, the single-shot vaccine showed 86% efficacy in the U.S. and 82% in South Africa; and in both locations, the vaccine showed 100% efficacy against hospitalization and death, Live Science reported. This means that no one given the vaccine in the clinical trials had died from COVID-19 or required hospitalization for the disease when assessed at 28 days post-vaccination. On Feb. 25, following the FDA analysis, Bahrain became the first country to authorize the vaccine for emergency use. The U.S. cleared the vaccine for emergency use on Feb. 27. Similar to the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, the Johnson & Johnson shot contains a weakened version of a common cold virus, known as an adenovirus, Live Science previously reported. Scientists genetically altered the adenovirus, named ad26, so it can no longer infect human cells and then added genes that code for the coronavirus spike protein. Once inside the body, the vaccine trains the immune system to recognize the spike protein and target the coronavirus for destruction. Janssen used a similar strategy to develop its existing Ebola vaccine. The shot can be stored for months at normal refrigerator temperatures. Sinopharm, the state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group, and the Beijing Institute of Biological Products developed a vaccine from an inactivated coronavirus, meaning a modified version of SARS-CoV-2 that cannot replicate. In late December, Sinopharm announced that the vaccine, called BBIBP-CorV, is more than 79% effective, according to preliminary data from late-stage clinical trials — that said, the company has not published said data. In the summer of 2020, China gave Sinopharm authorization to vaccinate construction workers, diplomats and students with one of its two COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including BBIBP-CorV, Live Science previously reported. Nearly 1 million people had received the vaccines by November, according to the company\\'s chairman. The United Arab Emirates authorized BBIBP-CorV for emergency use in September and then fully approved the vaccine in December. Bahrain and China also fully approved the vaccine in December, and Egypt authorized it for emergency use in January 2021, the Times reported. The vaccine is given in two doses spaced three weeks apart. Sinopharm\\'s second vaccine candidate, developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, also uses an inactivated coronavirus as its base. The vaccine has been authorized for emergency use in China and the U.A.E., but little is known about its efficacy. CanSino Biologics, in collaboration with the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, developed a COVID-19 vaccine using a weakened adenovirus, but one that naturally infects humans, not chimpanzees. Late-stage clinical trials with the vaccine are still ongoing, and its efficacy is not yet known. The shot is given in a single dose. In June 2020, the CanSino vaccine was given approval to be used by China\\'s military, according to Reuters. The Chinese company Sinovac Biotech developed a vaccine from an inactivated version of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine, called CoronaVac, is given in two doses 14 days apart, Live Science previously reported. China authorized the vaccine for emergency use in July. Estimates vary as to how well the vaccine protects against COVID-19, and an official estimate has not yet been issued. One clinical trial in Brazil suggested that the vaccine was about 78% effective in one small subgroup of patients, but across all people, the efficacy may be closer to 63%, according to Estadão, a Brazilian news outlet. On Jan. 12, researchers from the Butantan Institute, the biologic research center where the trails were conducted, announced that the efficacy rate is 50.4%, overall, based on the latest data, BBC News reported. The Indian company Bharat Biotech, along with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology developed a vaccine from an inactivated coronavirus, called Covaxin, the Times reported. The vaccine is given in two doses, spaced four weeks apart, and has been authorized for emergency use in India. It\\'s efficacy has not been publicly reported. The Russia Ministry of Health\\'s Gamaleya Research Institute developed a coronavirus vaccine candidate called Sputnik V, in reference to the world\\'s first artificial satellite, launched during the space race, Live Science previously reported. The vaccine contains two common cold viruses, or adenoviruses, that have been modified so they don\\'t replicate in humans; the modified viruses also contain genes that code for the coronavirus\\'s spike protein. —11 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across species —14 coronavirus myths busted by science —The 12 deadliest viruses on Earth In November, Russia announced that the vaccine is more than 91.4% effective in preventing COVID-19, according to early data from clinical trials. On Feb. 2, scientists reported that the vaccine has 91.6% efficacy, based on preliminary data from a late-stage trial published in The Lancet. Russia began offering the vaccine to its citizens as part of a mass vaccination campaign in November 2020, according to The New York Times. Russia had already approved the vaccine for limited use in August, when very little data from human trials was available, Live Science reported. Since November, Belarus, Argentina and Serbia have also authorized the vaccine for emergency use, the Times reported. On Jan. 15, Paraguay also authorized the vaccine for emergency use, Reuters reported. In October 2020, Russia granted \"regulatory approval\" to a second vaccine, one developed by the Vector Institute, a Russian biological research center, according to CNBC. The vaccine contains coronavirus peptides, which are small portions of proteins found in the virus. Like Sputnik V, the vaccine earned approval in Russia before large-scale clinical trials had been conducted. As of now, its efficacy is still unknown. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': '2,000-year-old chariot unearthed at Pompeii',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'An ornate four-wheeled chariot of iron, bronze and wood that archaeologists think was drawn by a team of horses in processions through Pompeii almost 2,000 years ago has been unearthed during excavations of a wealthy Roman villa just north of the ancient city’s walls. Archaeologists discovered the elaborate chariot, which still has imprints of organic materials such as its ropes and floral decorations, almost intact in a portico of the villa in the suburb of Civita Giuliana, facing the stables where the remains of three horses were found in 2018. The collapsing walls and roof of the villa helped preserve the chariot from 21st-century antiquities thieves, who had dug tunnels at the site that nearly reached the chariot, according to officials at the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, which is managed by Italy\\'s cultural heritage ministry. Related: See photos of an early Bronze Age chariot burial It\\'s thought the richly-adorned chariot may have been a pilentum referred to by some sources, which was not for everyday use or for agricultural transport, but featured in community festivities, parades, and processions. It\\'s the first time that this type of ceremonial chariot has been found in Italy, the statement said. The exceptional preservation and the fact that the chariot would have been such a show-stopper in its day has archaeologists amazed. \"I was astounded,\" Eric Poehler, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has written about ancient Pompeii, told NPR. \"Many of the vehicles I\\'d written about before ... are your standard station wagon or vehicle for taking the kids to soccer. This is a Lamborghini. This is an outright fancy, fancy car.\" Park director Massimo Osanna said in the statement that the chariot \"is an extraordinary discovery for the advancement of knowledge of the ancient world.\" She added, \"At Pompeii, vehicles used for transport have been found [in] the past… but nothing like the Civita Giuliana chariot.\"         The ancient city of Pompeii near Naples was destroyed when the nearby volcano Vesuviu erupted in A.D. 79, when pyroclastic flows of superheated gas spread throughout the surrounding settlements, killing more than 30,000 and burying the city under up to 10 feet (3 meters) of ash. Parts of the buried city were discovered in the late 1500s, and scientific excavations started there in the 18th century. In the 19th century, archaeologists developed a method of injecting plaster into the voids left by the remains of the dead in the ash layer — mostly of humans, but famously also a chained-up dog. The shapes of the three Roman horses found at Civita Giuliana a few years ago were the first time the technique had been used successfully on large mammals. Two of them had been harnessed with bits and bridles, possibly as their owner attempted \\xa0to escape the destruction. Related: Pompeii photos: Skeletal remains of victims of Vesuvius eruption Archaeologists say most of the newly unearthed chariot has survived intact, although its materials are extremely fragile. The shapes of the shaft and platform of the chariot, which were made of wood that has long since rotted away, and the imprint of its ropes have been preserved by injecting plaster into the voids that remain in the ash.  The ceremonial style of the chariot may have Greek origins; among its decorations are medallions that show figures of satyrs and nymphs associated with Eros, the Greek god of desire and sex, whose Roman counterpart was Cupid. \"One cannot exclude the possibility that this could have been a chariot used for rituals relating to marriage, for leading the bride to her new household,\" the statement said. The archaeological park at Pompeii is now a UNESCO World Heritage site that covers 170 acres (69 hectares) of the buried ancient city, but roughly 50 acres (20 ha) are still unexcavated. The latest excavations at Civita Giuliana began after looters dug tunnels to a closed-off area in search of antiquities they could sell illegally; a police investigation that started in 2014 eventually led to the arrest of more than 140 suspects and the recovery of about 2,000 ancient artifacts. Archaeological excavations since 2017 have revealed the looters dug an extensive network of tunnels into the ash, stealing or damaging many culturally important artifacts, the statement said. —Preserved Pompeii: Photos reveal a city in ash —30 of the world\\'s most valuable treasures that are still missing —24 amazing archaeological discoveries Both the looters and the archaeologists who excavated the area initially overlooked the chariot. They eventually \\xa0found it beneath the collapsed wooden ceiling of a two-level portico that opened onto an uncovered courtyard; an upper part of the chariot was revealed only when archaeologists preserved and removed carbonized wooden beams from the ceiling that lay above it. Scientists also used photogrammetry and laser scanning to record the elements of the chariot and the rooms that surround it; they transferred the remains of the chariot to the park\\'s laboratory, where restorers are working to remove more volcanic material from its metal parts.

       "  'Full Article': 'Fish school, insects swarm and birds fly in murmurations. Now, new research finds that on the most basic level, this kind of group behavior forms a new kind of active matter, called a swirlonic state. Physical laws such as Newton\\'s second law of motion — which states that as a force applied to an object increases, its acceleration increases, and that as the object\\'s mass increases, its acceleration decreases — apply to passive, nonliving matter, ranging from atoms to planets. But much of the matter in the world is active matter and moves under its own, self-directed, force, said Nikolai Brilliantov, a mathematician at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Russia and the University of Leicester in England. Living things as diverse as bacteria, birds and humans can interact with the forces upon them. There are examples of non-living active matter, too. Nanoparticles known as \"Janus particles,\" are made up of two sides with different chemical properties. The interactions between the two sides create self-propelled movement. Related: What\\'s that? Your physics questions answered To explore active matter, Brilliantov and his colleagues used a computer to simulate particles that could self-propel. These particles weren\\'t consciously interacting with the environment, Brilliantov told Live Science. Rather, they were more akin to simple bacteria or nanoparticles with internal sources of energy, but without information-processing abilities. The first surprise was that this active matter behaves very differently than passive matter. Different states of passive matter can coexist, Brilliantov said. For example, a glass of liquid water can gradually evaporate into a gaseous state while still leaving liquid water behind. The active matter, by contrast, didn\\'t coexist in different phases; it was all solid, all liquid or all gas. The particles also grouped together as large conglomerates, or quasi-particles, which milled together in a circular pattern around a central void, kind of like a swirl of schooling sardines. The researchers dubbed these particle conglomerates \"swirlons,\" and named the new state of matter they formed a \"swirlonic state.\" In this swirlonic state, the particles displayed bizarre behavior. For example, they violated Newton\\'s second law: When a force was applied to them, they did not accelerate. \"[They] just move with a constant velocity, which is absolutely surprising,\" Brilliantov said. — The biggest unsolved mysteries in physics — The 10 biggest physics stories of 2020 — The mysterious physics of 7 everyday things The simulations were basic, and experimental work with real-world active matter is an important next step, he said. Brilliantov and his colleagues also plan to do more complex simulations using active-matter particles with information-processing abilities. These will more closely resemble insects and animals and help to reveal the physical laws governing schooling, swarming and flocking. Ultimately the goal is to create self-assembling materials out of active matter, Brilliantov said, which makes it important to understand the phases of this kind of matter. \"It\\'s quite important that we see the nature of active matter\" is much richer than that of passive matter, Brilliantov said. The research was detailed in October 2020 in the journal Scientific Reports. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': 'Sprites and jets are fleeting atmospheric phenomena, hard enough to witness, let alone photograph. But a new image from an observatory in Hawaii captures both a red sprite and a blue jet in the same shot. The photo, released on Feb. 24, comes courtesy a \"cloud cam\" at the Gemini North telescope, part of the International Gemini Observatory located on Maunakea. Sprites and jets are upper-atmospheric phenomena caused by electrical discharges. Sprites, which are typically reddish-orange and sometimes blue-green, occur in the mesosphere, between 30 and 50 miles (50 and 80 kilometers) in altitude. They\\'re often triggered by regular, lower-altitude lightning, but are much cooler in temperature. They\\'re also sometimes shaped like jellyfish. Blue jets also occur at high altitude, triggered by a discharge of electricity from the positively-charged upper portion of a storm cloud to the negatively-charged cloud top, according to a paper published Jan. 20 in the journal Nature. They typically appear as blue streamers shooting spaceward. Related content: Elves, sprites and blue jets: Nature\\'s weirdest lightning The camera that captured the red sprite and blue jet was a modified consumer-grade DSLR (digital single-lens reflex), customized to take photographs within a fraction of a second to 30 seconds after lightning strikes. The cameras are mounted on the roof of the observatory, pointed toward the most likely locations of incoming storms. The Gemini North Observatory sits at 13,800 feet (4,200 meters), affording a fabulous view of the surrounding weather. — Electric Earth: Stunning images of lightning — How big can lightning get? — Weirdo weather: 7 rare weather events Though sprites and jets are rarely witnessed from the ground, they\\'re not uncommon above thunderstorms. In 2017, an astronaut aboard the International Space Station witnessed 245 blue flashes in 160 seconds over one storm. Scientists debate whether these phenomena are simply transient or whether they have any lasting effects. For example, if their passage alters the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, they might have an effect on the ozone layer, researcher Hans Stenbaek-Nielsen of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks told Live Science in 2011. Studying sprites and jets is difficult, physicist Ryan Haaland of Fort Lewis College in Colorado told Live Science in 2015. Scientists take measurements from ground-based observatories and sometimes fly specially-instrumented research aircraft close to storms to detect them. But as the phenomena last just tens of milliseconds, they remain mysterious. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': \"Gwyneth Paltrow's wacky COVID-19 treatments have no medical justification\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Infrared saunas and skipping breakfast — yep, Gwyneth Paltrow is at it again. \\xa0The actress and Goop \"lifestyle guru\" recently touted some unproven methods for treating lingering symptoms of COVID-19. Not surprisingly, experts are very, very skeptical. In a blog post on Goop, the actress\\'s wellness brand website, Paltrow wrote that she had COVID-19 \"early on\" and that disease left her with \"brain fog\" and \"long-tail fatigue.\" She then went on to describe how she\\'s been treating these symptoms by fasting until 11 a.m. every day (a.k.a. skipping breakfast), following a \"keto and plant-based\" diet, drinking bottled mocktails and visiting an \"infrared sauna.\" However, experts said there was no evidence that any of Paltrow\\'s remedies could help with prolonged symptoms of COVID-19, also known as \"long COVID.\" \"I know of no scientific rationale for this approach and know of no data from clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy of these interventions,\" Dr. Michael Saag, an infectious disease expert from the University of Alabama at Birmingham told Live Science. \"Caveat emptor,\" or buyer beware, Saag said of Paltrow\\'s recommendations. Related: 14 coronavirus myths busted by science The director of the National Health Service (NHS) England, Stephen Powis, also rebuked her advice. \"In the last few days I see\\xa0Gwyneth Paltrow\\xa0is unfortunately suffering from the effects of COVID. We wish her well, but some of the solutions she\\'s recommending are really not the solutions we\\'d recommend in the NHS,\" he said, according to The Guardian. \"We need to take long COVID seriously and apply serious science. All influencers who use social media have a duty of responsibility and a duty of care around that,\" he added. Paltrow and Goop have a history of providing dubious medical advice. Goop has advised people to put jade eggs in their vaginas, which could lead to bacterial infection, as Live Science previously reported, and to perform \"coffee enemas,\" a type of colon cleansing that doctors consider to be potentially dangerous. Paltrow\\'s medical advice also comes with a hefty conflict of interest: Goop, which was worth $250 million in 2018, according to The New York Times, makes money selling products that Paltrow and others recommend on the site. At the top of Paltrow\\'s blog post on long COVID is a box titled \"Shop The Story,\" which offers links to buy, on the Goop website, vitamin supplements mentioned in Paltrow\\'s post. She also offers to sell the mocktails (and a crystal double old-fashioned glass in which to drink them) to readers through the Goop website or links to other sites with which Goop is partnering. —20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history —25 medical myths that just won\\'t go away —Wishful thinking: 6 \\'magic bullet\\' cures that don\\'t exist People who survive COVID-19 have reported a range of lingering symptoms weeks and months after infection. These range from fatigue, joint pain, and shortness of breath, which are more common symptoms following COVID-19, to damage to the heart, lungs and brain, according to the Mayo Clinic. Damage to the heart muscle associated with having had COVID-19 has also been found in people who only had mild symptoms of COVID-19. Brain fog, which Paltrow reported, is indeed a long-term symptom of COVID, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nobody is disputing that Paltrow\\'s symptoms could be related to COVID-19. It\\'s her recommendations for managing those symptoms that have come into question. After all, there are no treatments for long COVID as of yet. \"And that is frustrating!\" Saag told Live Science. It\\'s a \"new disease state\" and researchers are \"having trouble even defining it accurately,\" which leads to problems knowing how many people are affected, Saag wrote in an email. Still, Saag added that her advice may not necessarily be harmful. \"I don\\'t see a huge amount of harm from keto or plant-based diets [or] not eating until 11 a.m.,\" Saag said. \"Folks can try them but I wouldn\\'t necessarily count [on] results.\" However, \"I worry a bit about infrared spa concepts,\" said Saag, who added that the practice could pose a risk of dehydration and overheating. Unlike traditional saunas, which use heat to warm the air, infrared saunas use infrared light waves to warm the body directly. Although infrared saunas haven\\'t been associated with adverse effects, there is little evidence that they provide a health benefit, and the Canadian government has warned against using infrared saunas in place of proven medical treatments. \"My judgment is that the risks outweigh any benefits, which appear marginal at best,\" Saag said. Editor\\'s note: This article was updated on March 1 at 11:15 a.m. ET to include additional quotes from Dr. Saag about the potential risks of infrared saunas.
